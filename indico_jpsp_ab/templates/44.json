This microbunching is an inherent process in the free-electron laser (FEL) mechanism for both single-pass and oscillator configurations. Besides the FEL output, diagnostics of these microbunched electron beams can be performed using coherent optical transition radiation (COTR) and imaging techniques in the former case. In these cases, the COTR from the microbunched portion of the beam in 6-D space generally dominates the images. Other mechanisms include the longitudinal-space-charge-induced microbunching in ultra-bright beams and laser-induced microbunching such as observed in laser wakefield accelerator beams. More recently, we consider the diagnostics of the TESSA** FEL concepts where a seed laser co-propagating with the electron beam through a short modulator and  chicane may result in bunching fractions of >10 % leading to COTR enhancements of >22 million. Examples of these past, present, and future investigations will be discussed.\r\n\r\n**Tapering Enhanced Super-radiant Stimulated Amplification (TESSA)","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/518\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Alex","last_name":"Lumpkin","fullName":"Lumpkin, Alex","id":"1929","affiliation":"Argonne National Laboratory","emailHash":"a66a124168c83b29a2612ab40b2b6542","db_id":1929,"person_id":1932}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Alex","last_name":"Lumpkin","fullName":"Lumpkin, Alex","id":"1929","affiliation":"Argonne National Laboratory","emailHash":"a66a124168c83b29a2612ab40b2b6542","db_id":1929,"person_id":1932}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":"Electron diagnostics, timing, synchronization & controls","session":"FEL Prize","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"MOBI3","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"270","db_id":599,"friendly_id":270,"title":"Laser Assisted Beam Manipulation Techniques for Fully Coherent and Ultra-Short FEL Generation","startDate":{"date":"2022-08-22","time":"12:35:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2022-08-22","time":"12:55:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Auditorium Generali","room":"Auditorium Generali","note":{},"location":"Trieste Convention Centre","type":"Invited Orals","description":"Laser assisted beam manipulation has been extensively used in modern high gain FELs to tailor the output properties.

Strongly compressed 16.5GeV electron\r\nbeam combined with maximized orbit dispersion allowed us to generate 1keV-\r\nand 1mJ-order radiation with predominantly less than 2 spectral spikes.\r\nThis operation mode was also employed to generate 100uJ-order pump-probe\r\npulses.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/336\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Svitozar","last_name":"Serkez","fullName":"Serkez, Svitozar","id":"585","affiliation":"European XFEL GmbH","emailHash":"b785e1f823ef856de0f906c5417cfd4e","db_id":585,"person_id":1559}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Svitozar","last_name":"Serkez","fullName":"Serkez, Svitozar","id":"585","affiliation":"European XFEL GmbH","emailHash":"b785e1f823ef856de0f906c5417cfd4e","db_id":585,"person_id":1559}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":"SASE FEL","session":"SASE FELs","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"TUAI2","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"191","db_id":337,"friendly_id":191,"title":"Cascaded Amplification of Attosecond X-Ray Pulses: Towards TW-Scale Ultrafast X-Ray Free-Electron Lasers","startDate":{"date":"2022-08-23","time":"08:45:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2022-08-23","time":"09:15:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":30,"roomFullname":"Auditorium Generali","room":"Auditorium Generali","note":{},"location":"Trieste Convention Centre","type":"Invited Orals","description":"The natural time scale of valence electronic motion in molecular systems is on the order of hundreds of attoseconds. Consequently, the time-resolved study of electronic dynamics requires a source of sub-femtosecond pulses. Pulses in the soft x-ray domain can access core-level electrons, enabling the study of site-specific electron dynamics through attosecond pump\/probe experiments. As time-resolved pump\/probe experiments are nonlinear processes, these experiments require high brightness attosecond x-ray pulses. The X-ray Laser-Enhanced Attosecond Pulses (XLEAP) collaboration is an ongoing project for the development of attosecond x-ray modes at the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS). Here we report development of a high power attosecond mode via cascaded amplification of the x-ray pulse. We experimentally demonstrate generation of sub-femtosecond duration soft x-ray free electron laser pulses with hundreds of microjoules of energy. In conjunction with the upcoming high repetition rate at LCLS-II, these tunable, high intensity attosecond capabilities enable new nonlinear spectroscopic techniques and advanced imaging methods.\r\n\r\nThis work was supported by US Department of Energy Contracts No. DE-AC02-76SF00 and the Basic Energy Sciences Accelerator and Detector Research

performance of an X-ray free-electron-laser (FEL) using the optical klystron mechanism and helical undulator configuration in comparison to a standard planar undulator without optical klystron. The demonstration has been carried out at Athos, the soft X-ray beamline of SwissFEL. Athos has variable-polarization undulators and small magnetic chicanes placed between every two undulator modules to fully exploit the optical klystron. It is shown that, for wavelengths between 1 and 3 nm, the required length to achieve FEL saturation is reduced by about a factor of two when using both the optical klystron and helical undulators, with each effect accounting for about half of the improvements. Moreover, it is shown that a helical undulator configuration provides a 20% or higher saturation power than planar undulators. This work represents an important step towards more compact and high-power FELs, rendering this key technology more efficient, affordable, and accessible to the scientific community.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/358\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Christoph","last_name":"Kittel","fullName":"Kittel, Christoph","id":"679","affiliation":"Paul Scherrer Institute","emailHash":"8af34f39f2d8863ad0f90ea75c1da169","db_id":679,"person_id":1884},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Marco","last_name":"Calvi","fullName":"Calvi, Marco","id":"678","affiliation":"Paul Scherrer Institut","emailHash":"faccb42a0ed4e691ad10d2e45d7360d3","db_id":678,"person_id":1199},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Nicholas","last_name":"Sammut","fullName":"Sammut, Nicholas","id":"677","affiliation":"Department of Microelectronics and Nanoelectronics, Faculty of Information and Communication Technology, University of Malta, Msida MSD2080, Malta","emailHash":"0bb5bf644898a47e3d5ffe42d131cf3f","db_id":677,"person_id":1885},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Guanglei","last_name":"Wang","fullName":"Wang, Guanglei","id":"676","affiliation":"Paul Scherrer Institut, Forschungsstrasse 111, 5232 Villigen PSI, Switzerland","emailHash":"8eba57081cffe5e47299c702ae282589","db_id":676,"person_id":1751},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Eduard","last_name":"Prat","fullName":"Prat, Eduard","id":"680","affiliation":"Paul Scherrer Institut","emailHash":"32e11d370b0b3ed9b2d920d624b2dd94","db_id":680,"person_id":1667}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Christoph","last_name":"Kittel","fullName":"Kittel, Christoph","id":"679","affiliation":"Paul Scherrer Institute","emailHash":"8af34f39f2d8863ad0f90ea75c1da169","db_id":679,"person_id":1884},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Marco","last_name":"Calvi","fullName":"Calvi, Marco","id":"678","affiliation":"Paul Scherrer Institut","emailHash":"faccb42a0ed4e691ad10d2e45d7360d3","db_id":678,"person_id":1199},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Nicholas","last_name":"Sammut","fullName":"Sammut, Nicholas","id":"677","affiliation":"Department of Microelectronics and Nanoelectronics, Faculty of Information and Communication Technology, University of Malta, Msida MSD2080, Malta","emailHash":"0bb5bf644898a47e3d5ffe42d131cf3f","db_id":677,"person_id":1885},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Guanglei","last_name":"Wang","fullName":"Wang, Guanglei","id":"676","affiliation":"Paul Scherrer Institut, Forschungsstrasse 111, 5232 Villigen PSI, Switzerland","emailHash":"8eba57081cffe5e47299c702ae282589","db_id":676,"person_id":1751},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Eduard","last_name":"Prat","fullName":"Prat, Eduard","id":"680","affiliation":"Paul Scherrer Institut","emailHash":"32e11d370b0b3ed9b2d920d624b2dd94","db_id":680,"person_id":1667}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":"SASE FEL","session":"SASE FELs","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"TUAO3","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"7","db_id":361,"friendly_id":7,"title":"Two-Colored FEL Generation Using Phase Shifters at Undulator","startDate":{"date":"2022-08-23","time":"10:10:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2022-08-23","time":"10:35:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":25,"roomFullname":"Auditorium Generali","room":"Auditorium Generali","note":{},"location":"Trieste Convention Centre","type":"Contributed Oral","description":"Phase shifters at undulator line are usually used for optimizing FEL intensity by setting 'in-phase' by matching the FEL pulse and electrons phases. \u03c0-offset so called \u2018out-phase\u2019 may suppress FEL intensity at the resonant frequency, therefore the 'out-phase' condition is an unwanted state.

partially coherent synchrotron radiation pulses from undulators. Wavefront propagation simulations play a pivotal role in designing beamline optics at new synchrotron radiation sources. However, they do not account for the stochastic behaviour of the initial radiation field, which is due to shot noise in the electron beam with finite transverse size and divergence. We present an algorithm that allows us to obtain and propagate radiation fields containing multiple transverse stochastic modes within undulator resonance. The proposed algorithm relies on a method for simulating Gaussian random fields. We initially generate the field as Gaussian white noise, and then we restrict its extent in the direct and in the reciprocal domains by using averaged radiation size and divergence. Strictly speaking, this procedure shapes the correct correlation function of the field only under the assumption of quasi-homogeneity. However, we show that the method can be applied with reasonable accuracy also outside of this assumption. We check consistency of the algorithm with the help of well-established approaches in simulating partially coherent undulator fields. Finally, the proposed method is well-suited for educational purposes.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/388\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Andrei","last_name":"Trebushinin","fullName":"Trebushinin, Andrei","id":"983","affiliation":"European XFEL GmbH","emailHash":"de7e9c71299c86723ebc43a80b575666","db_id":983,"person_id":1672},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Gianluca","last_name":"Geloni","fullName":"Geloni, Gianluca","id":"2700","affiliation":"European XFEL GmbH","emailHash":"888c154fdafc596a3176b261a392bf3f","db_id":2700,"person_id":1277},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Svitozar","last_name":"Serkez","fullName":"Serkez, Svitozar","id":"982","affiliation":"European XFEL GmbH","emailHash":"b785e1f823ef856de0f906c5417cfd4e","db_id":982,"person_id":1559}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Andrei","last_name":"Trebushinin","fullName":"Trebushinin, Andrei","id":"983","affiliation":"European XFEL GmbH","emailHash":"de7e9c71299c86723ebc43a80b575666","db_id":983,"person_id":1672},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Gianluca","last_name":"Geloni","fullName":"Geloni, Gianluca","id":"2700","affiliation":"European XFEL GmbH","emailHash":"888c154fdafc596a3176b261a392bf3f","db_id":2700,"person_id":1277},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Svitozar","last_name":"Serkez","fullName":"Serkez, Svitozar","id":"982","affiliation":"European XFEL GmbH","emailHash":"b785e1f823ef856de0f906c5417cfd4e","db_id":982,"person_id":1559}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":"FEL Theory","session":"Monday posters","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"MOP03","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"210","db_id":488,"friendly_id":210,"title":"Simulation Studies of Superconducting Afterburner Operation at SASE2 Beamline of European XFEL","startDate":{"date":"2022-08-22","time":"17:10:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2022-08-22","time":"17:30:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Exhibition Hall","room":"Exhibition Hall","note":{},"location":"Trieste Convention Centre","type":"Contributed Poster","description":"European XFEL is a multi-beamline x-ray free-electron laser (FEL) user facility driven by a superconducting accelerator with a nominal photon energy range from 250 eV to 25 keV.

This afterburner undulator would be installed downstream of the already operating SASE2 FEL beamline, emitting at the fundamental or at a harmonic of the upstream SASE2 undulator.

Although this has been accomplished in XUV and hard X-rays in a free-electron-laser facility, it remains a challenge in the soft X-ray region due to the relatively high photon energies and large slippage in the undulator. In this contribution, we present a method to achieve a pulse sequence of \u223c 120 attosecond each in average at 293.8 eV photon energy (4 nm wavelength), which covers the K-shell absorption of Carbon. The key is to create a linear undulator taper within each undulator module by rotating a transverse gradient undulator (TGU) at a small angle. The TGU technique is usually referred to minimise the energy spread effect in Laser-driven plasma accelerator, while in this paper we demonstrate that it can also be used to generate short pulses.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/442\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Longdi","last_name":"Zhu","fullName":"Zhu, Longdi","id":"1357","affiliation":"Paul Scherrer Institut","emailHash":"94e2e5fcff10bc4c9c3331ecdb58c0fa","db_id":1357,"person_id":1443},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Sven","last_name":"Reiche","fullName":"Reiche, Sven","id":"2683","affiliation":"Paul Scherrer Institut","emailHash":"4bbd5078fd07b129c2524e6aba1cc659","db_id":2683,"person_id":1539},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Eugenio","last_name":"Ferrari","fullName":"Ferrari, Eugenio","id":"2684","affiliation":"Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron","emailHash":"8f799979a036f7a71d798b31a9441035","db_id":2684,"person_id":1779}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Longdi","last_name":"Zhu","fullName":"Zhu, Longdi","id":"1357","affiliation":"Paul Scherrer Institut","emailHash":"94e2e5fcff10bc4c9c3331ecdb58c0fa","db_id":1357,"person_id":1443}],"coauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Sven","last_name":"Reiche","fullName":"Reiche, Sven","id":"2683","affiliation":"Paul Scherrer Institut","emailHash":"4bbd5078fd07b129c2524e6aba1cc659","db_id":2683,"person_id":1539},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Eugenio","last_name":"Ferrari","fullName":"Ferrari, Eugenio","id":"2684","affiliation":"Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron","emailHash":"8f799979a036f7a71d798b31a9441035","db_id":2684,"person_id":1779}],"keywords":[],"track":"SASE FEL","session":"Monday posters","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"MOP55","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"205","db_id":514,"friendly_id":205,"title":"Evolution of Microbunching in Drift Sections","startDate":{"date":"2022-08-22","time":"17:10:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2022-08-22","time":"17:30:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Exhibition Hall","room":"Exhibition Hall","note":{},"location":"Trieste Convention Centre","type":"Contributed Poster","description":"The typical layout adopted in a seeded harmonic generation free-electron laser is based on radiator undulators placed immediately after the dispersive section, where the bunching is created. \r\nWith the advent of new and more complex seeding schemes, this solution cannot always be implemented and cases, where the bunched beam needs to be propagated in free space before entering the radiator, should be investigated.   \r\nThe evolution of the density modulation in a drift may also plays a role on long intra-undulator sections in short wavelength FELs.\r\nWe report here on recent studies aimed at investigating the impact of bunching evolution in a drift space on coherent harmonic emission.

being designed and built at Eindhoven University of Technology as part of a European Interreg program between The Netherlands and Belgium. This compact X-ray source will bridge the gap between conventional lab sources and synchrotrons: The X-ray photon energy will be generated between 1 and 100 keV with a brilliance typically a few orders of magnitude above the best available lab sources. Smart*Light will find applications in material science, cultural heritage and medical imaging. \r\nIn the ICS process photons from a laser pulse bounce off a relativistic electron bunch, turning them into X-ray photons through the relativistic Doppler effect. In the first phase Smart*Light will use a 100 kV DC photogun as electron source and compact X-band linear accelerator technology developed by the CLIC program from CERN to accelerate the electrons further to an energy of 30 MeV. A 12 mJ, 800 nm, 100 fs laser pulse will be focused to a 5 spot and interact with the electron pulse that will be also focused to a spot of about 5 m resulting in an X-ray photon flux of 105 photons per pulse at 1 kHz rep rate, in 1% bandwidth, with an energy up to 40 keV.\r\nThe setup is currently under construction.

Indeed, they are insulating in the bulk and metallic at the surface. Moreover, these metallic surface states have linear Dirac dispersion [1], thanks to which topological insulators show nonlinear THz behaviour similar to the case of graphene.\r\nBi$_2$Se$_3$ is among the most promising topological insulators, since its band structure provides only one Dirac cone, while the bulk gap is pretty large (about 300 meV) [2]. \r\nIt has been demonstrated that by terahertz-infrared spectroscopy it is possible to detect the Dirac surface state by patterning thin films of Bi$_2$Se$_3$ with ribbons of width from 2 to 20 \u03bcm. In this way, a Dirac plasmon is excited and its dispersion recovers very well the theoretical dispersion, calculated by using the parameters of the Dirac carriers [3]. \r\nIn this scenario, we present here our investigation on the nonlinear regime of patterned films of Bi$_2$Se$_3$ with ribbons of width of 4 and 20 \u03bcm. By exploiting the intense THz electric field of the TeraFERMI beamline, we were able to induce a nonlinear behaviour of the Dirac plasmon. Indeed, we observed a redshift of the plasmonic peak as the incoming THz electric field increases [4].","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/560\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Johannes","last_name":"Schmidt","fullName":"Schmidt, Johannes","id":"2212","affiliation":"Elettra-Sincrotrone Trieste S.C.p.A.","emailHash":"ddeaf1d2be3a733eb11ccef607909e70","db_id":2212,"person_id":2154}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Paola","last_name":"Di Pietro","fullName":"Di Pietro, Paola","id":"2217","affiliation":"Elettra-Sincrotrone Trieste S.C.p.A.","emailHash":"8755666515f492f52947843c6044e5e4","db_id":2217,"person_id":2153}],"coauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Alessandra","last_name":"Di Gaspare","fullName":"Di Gaspare, Alessandra","id":"2214","affiliation":"Istituto Nanoscienze-CNR, Laboratorio NEST","emailHash":"12c1d0b22bf22cbcef213b3c519fa43a","db_id":2214,"person_id":2157},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Andrea","last_name":"Perucchi","fullName":"Perucchi, Andrea","id":"2213","affiliation":"Elettra-Sincrotrone Trieste S.C.p.A.","emailHash":"cdb37d28eb52a690d3565f93932fa3c2","db_id":2213,"person_id":2158},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Federica","last_name":"Piccirilli","fullName":"Piccirilli, Federica","id":"2218","affiliation":"Elettra-Sincrotrone Trieste S.C.p.A.","emailHash":"00ffef7208e2bba69c20e5872f1b5508","db_id":2218,"person_id":2159},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Nidhi","last_name":"Adhlakha","fullName":"Adhlakha, Nidhi","id":"2216","affiliation":"Elettra-Sincrotrone Trieste S.C.p.A.","emailHash":"336d5ebc5436534e61d16e63ddfca327","db_id":2216,"person_id":2156},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Stefano","last_name":"Lupi","fullName":"Lupi, Stefano","id":"2215","affiliation":"Sapienza University of Rome","emailHash":"bffb66dcb4b7c3d9cc36064ce4c31c05","db_id":2215,"person_id":2140}],"keywords":[],"track":"User experiments","session":"Monday posters","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"MOP62","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"242","db_id":576,"friendly_id":242,"title":"Nonlinear Spectroscopy at the THz-Beamline TeraFERMI","startDate":{"date":"2022-08-22","time":"17:10:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2022-08-22","time":"17:30:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Exhibition Hall","room":"Exhibition Hall","note":{},"location":"Trieste Convention Centre","type":"Contributed Poster","description":"TeraFERMI is a THz beamline at the free-electron laser (FEL) FERMI. After passing the FEL's undulator, the electron bunches are refocused on a thin dielectric slab and generate coherent transition radiation (CTR), namely strong THz pulses. TeraFERMI provides single-cycle pulses with a broadband spectrum in the range from 0.1 THz to 6 THz and strong peak electric fields with up to 4 MV\/cm or peak magnetic fields of up to 1 T well-suited for nonlinear experiments driving systems out of equilibrium. The low repetition rate of 50 Hz allows the systems under study to fully relax to their equilibrium state between consecutive pulses, thereby avoiding unwanted thermal effects, a feature which is particularly requested in interdisciplinary experiments in biophysics or chemical physics. A particular property of the THz radiation (CTR-sources) is the radial polarization, which allows for studies with longitudinal spectroscopy exploiting an electric field polarization parallel to the propagation direction of focused beams. Furthermore, all time-resolved experiments benefit from the excellent synchronization between THz-pulses and a local near-infrared laser with a low timing jitter of 66 fs. In this contribution we report about the latest progress at TeraFERMI including a recently implemented diagnostic station as well as experimental setups we provide at TeraFERMI.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/576\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Johannes","last_name":"Schmidt","fullName":"Schmidt, Johannes","id":"2348","affiliation":"Elettra-Sincrotrone Trieste S.C.p.A.","emailHash":"ddeaf1d2be3a733eb11ccef607909e70","db_id":2348,"person_id":2154}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Johannes","last_name":"Schmidt","fullName":"Schmidt, Johannes","id":"2348","affiliation":"Elettra-Sincrotrone Trieste S.C.p.A.","emailHash":"ddeaf1d2be3a733eb11ccef607909e70","db_id":2348,"person_id":2154}],"coauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Andrea","last_name":"Perucchi","fullName":"Perucchi, Andrea","id":"2350","affiliation":"Elettra-Sincrotrone Trieste S.C.p.A.","emailHash":"daca93213e483df2ff3a6608daf6541d","db_id":2350,"person_id":2155},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Paola","last_name":"Di Pietro","fullName":"Di Pietro, Paola","id":"2349","affiliation":"Elettra-Sincrotrone Trieste S.C.p.A.","emailHash":"8755666515f492f52947843c6044e5e4","db_id":2349,"person_id":2153}],"keywords":[],"track":"User experiments","session":"Monday posters","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"MOP61","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"207","db_id":445,"friendly_id":207,"title":"Report on the FELIX Wavelength Range Extension","startDate":{"date":"2022-08-22","time":"17:10:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2022-08-22","time":"17:30:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Exhibition Hall","room":"Exhibition Hall","note":{},"location":"Trieste Convention Centre","type":"Contributed Poster","description":"The FELIX Laboratory, located at Radboud University in Nijmegen, The Netherlands, is operating a suite of FELs serving an international user community with infrared and THz radiation from 5 to 1500 micron operating three FELs in parallel and providing beam to 16 dedicated user end stations. Recently, FELIX has upgraded its most frequently used FEL-2 beamline. The 38 period, 65 mm Halbach-type SmCo undulator, originally built for the UK-FEL project in the mid 80's, which had been successfully used for the short-wavelength FEL for almost 30 years, was replaced by a new undulator. This 50 period, 40 mm NdFeB hybrid undulator was built in close collaboration with STI magnetics and the FEL group of FHI\/MPG in Berlin. Together with a new resonator cavity it allows an extension of the fundamental range from 5 \u00b5m to sub-3 \u00b5m, while keeping the desirable good spectral overlap with the longer wavelength FEL-1 branch. The upgraded FEL-2 beam line produced first light at the end of April 2022 and commenced serving regular user experiments in early May. Initial results concerning gain and wavelength range which are quite satisfactory will be presented together with the first user application.","folders":[{"_type":"folder","id":211,"title":null,"description":"","attachments":[],"default_folder":true,"is_protected":false}],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/445\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Victor","last_name":"Claessen","fullName":"Claessen,

cavity feedback to support generation of fully coherent x-rays\r\nof high brilliance and stability by electrons in undulators. CBXFEL\r\noptical cavities comprise Bragg-reflecting flat crystal mirrors, which\r\nensure x-rays circulation on a closed orbit, and x-ray refractive\r\nlenses, which stabilize the orbit and refocus the x-rays back on the\r\nelectrons in the undulator. Depending on the cavity design, there are\r\ntens of degrees of freedom of the optical elements, which can never be\r\nperfectly aligned. Here [1], we study signatures of misalignment of the\r\noptical components and of the undulator source with the purposes of\r\nunderstanding the effects of misalignment on x-ray beam dynamics,\r\nunderstanding misalignment tolerances, and developing cavity alignment\r\nprocedures.  Betatron oscillations of the x-ray beam trajectory are\r\none of the characteristic signatures of cavity misalignment. The\r\noscillation period is in the general case a non-integer number of\r\nround-trip passes of x-rays in the cavity. This period (unlike the\r\namplitude and offset of the oscillations) is independent of the type\r\nof misalignment and is defined by cavity parameters.  The studies are\r\nperformed on an example of a four-crystal rectangular cavity [2] using\r\nanalytical and numerical wave optics as well as ray-tracing\r\ntechniques. \r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n[1].

Such a method typically requires a pulsed radiation source and high energy resolution, along with a large data statistic. In this work we demonstrate the possibility to retrieve high resolution absorption and emission spectra with picosecond time resolution, by exploiting the stochastic nature of the wide-band self-amplified FEL radiation provided by FERMI. In this work we get advantage of the two spectrometers present on the TIMEX beamline to reconstruct a 2D emission\/absorption spectrum of a Si sample. To do so, we applied the singular value decomposition on the single-pulse incoming and outgoing spectra; by applying Tikhonov regularization, we were able to obtain spectra with an energy resolution of few tens of meV. In addition, we performed a time resolved characterization of the Si L23-edge and Si emission line at 99.3 eV by pumping the Si sample with visible laser below damage threshold. The result of this measurement allow us to claim for a bond softening phenomenon on the picosecond time-scale.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/443\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Dario","last_name":"De

which cannot model sub-wavelength effects, such as Coherent Spontaneous Emission from the electron pulse. In this paper, the unaveraged FEL simulation code Puffin is used with the optics code Optical Propagation Code to model the FEL in three dimensions, enabling sub-wavelength effects to be modelled at the FEL interaction and cavity length scales. The parameters used are very similar to those of the IR-FEL of [1].\r\nResults show that CSE does drive the FEL interaction during the start-up phase in the cavity. Further, cavity detuning effects at the sub-wavelength scale can have an effect upon the FEL output from start-up through to the steady state output. \r\nWhile the effects are demonstrated here at the fundamental level, it can be expected that they may be reduced due to limitations such as electron beam and\/or cavity length jitter at the wavelength scale. Such effects will need to be further investigated.","folders":[{"_type":"folder","id":199,"title":null,"description":"","attachments":[],"default_folder":true,"is_protected":false}],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/559\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Pornthep","last_name":"Pongchalee","fullName":"Pongchalee, Pornthep","id":"2210","affiliation":"University of Strathclyde, Cockcroft Institute and ASTeC, STFC Daresbury Laboratory","emailHash":"b65d177a9f25da2d54386bffe06c1e8a","db_id":2210,"person_id":1846},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Brian","last_name":"McNeil","fullName":"McNeil, Brian","id":"2211","affiliation":"University of Strathclyde and Cockcroft Institute","emailHash":"73d050c8501e043475c7f875e22839dd","db_id":2211,"person_id":1847}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Pornthep","last_name":"Pongchalee","fullName":"Pongchalee, Pornthep","id":"2210","affiliation":"University of Strathclyde, Cockcroft Institute and ASTeC, STFC Daresbury Laboratory","emailHash":"b65d177a9f25da2d54386bffe06c1e8a","db_id":2210,"person_id":1846},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Brian","last_name":"McNeil","fullName":"McNeil, Brian","id":"2211","affiliation":"University of Strathclyde and Cockcroft Institute","emailHash":"73d050c8501e043475c7f875e22839dd","db_id":2211,"person_id":1847}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":"FEL oscillators & IR-FEL","session":"Monday posters","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"MOP32","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"147","db_id":421,"friendly_id":147,"title":"FEL Performance of the EuPRAXIA@SPARC LAB AQUA Beamline","startDate":{"date":"2022-08-22","time":"17:10:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2022-08-22","time":"17:30:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Exhibition Hall","room":"Exhibition Hall","note":{},"location":"Trieste Convention Centre","type":"Contributed Poster","description":"The AQUA beamline of the EuPRAXIA@SPARC_LAB infrastructure consists of a Free-Electron Laser facility driven by an electron beam with 1 GeV energy, produced by an X-band normal conducting LINAC followed by a plasma wakefield acceleration stage, with the goal to deliver variable polarization photons in the 3-4 nm wavelength range.

burst or in continuous wave mode of operation, offering an unprecedented number of electron bunches per second. External seeding techniques provide high quality FEL pulses of full coherence and  shot-to-shot stability but cannot keep up with MHz repetition rates of such FELs due to their dependence on the seed laser repetition rate. One attractive solution to overcome this limitation is to employ an optical cavity to store radiation that acts as a seed for the electron bunches arriving at high repetition rates. Such a scheme not only allows seeded operation at multi-MHz repetition rates but also introduces the possibility to achieve seeded radiation at shorter wavelengths, overcoming the hurdle of insufficient power availability of seed laser systems in the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) wavelength range. Here, we present different optical-cavity-based schemes and we give an overview of their unique capabilities together with simulation results.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/503\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Georgia","last_name":"Paraskaki","fullName":"Paraskaki,

To overcome the coherence time barrier, a modification of the chirp-taper scheme [1] is used in the case of soft x-rays.

We are using a waveguide-based optical resonator for our FEL system. Firstly, we report on the selection of low loss and small cross-section waveguide candidate to enhance the gain of THz FEL. We performed a detailed analysis of waveguides with different shapes and size via COMSOL Multiphysics simulation. Based on the simulation result, we found that a waveguide with a special eye-shaped cross-section has a very small cross-sectional area of 4 mm$^2$ at full width at half maximum (FWHM) and a very low wave loss of less than 2.5% for 1-m propagation at an operating wavelength of 300\u2013600 \u00b5m.\r\nSecondly, we accomplished the optimization of the Wire-Grid-Polarizer (WGP) design parameter via COMSOL Multiphysics code, we calculated the optimized values of grating length and grating period of the WGP  i.e., 20 \u00b5m and 100 \u00b5m, which have less than 10% of loss for the wavelength of 300\u2013600 \u00b5m. The material which we used for WGP  simulation is Tungsten coated with gold because it has a high extinction ratio and transmission as compared with common grating material.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/555\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Varun","last_name":"Pathania","fullName":"Pathania, Varun","id":"2174","affiliation":"Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute","emailHash":"ae2e2bec073319795092586563b5824e","db_id":2174,"person_id":1723}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Varun","last_name":"Pathania","fullName":"Pathania, Varun","id":"2174","affiliation":"Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute","emailHash":"ae2e2bec073319795092586563b5824e","db_id":2174,"person_id":1723}],"coauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Sangyoon","last_name":"Bae","fullName":"Bae, Sangyoon","id":"2176","affiliation":"Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute","emailHash":"146d796ca398739fecf38a05b647e3ad","db_id":2176,"person_id":1720},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Jang","last_name":"Kyu-Ha","fullName":"Kyu-Ha, Jang","id":"2173","affiliation":"Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute","emailHash":"2d1a47a8ac967daa5f8db5f4d49c6388","db_id":2173,"person_id":1719},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Kitae","last_name":"Lee","fullName":"Lee, Kitae","id":"2175","affiliation":"Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute","emailHash":null,"db_id":2175,"person_id":1722},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Young Uk","last_name":"Jeong","fullName":"Jeong, Young Uk","id":"2172","affiliation":"Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute","emailHash":"ea0a0c601d9f0f5cfcd04a08b50065b0","db_id":2172,"person_id":1718}],"keywords":[],"track":"FEL oscillators & IR-FEL","session":"Monday posters","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"MOP24","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"127","db_id":395,"friendly_id":127,"title":"Low-Emittance Beam Injection from SACLA to SPring-8","startDate":{"date":"2022-08-22","time":"17:10:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2022-08-22","time":"17:30:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Exhibition Hall","room":"Exhibition Hall","note":{},"location":"Trieste Convention Centre","type":"Contributed Poster","description":"The SACLA linear accelerator has been successfully used as a full-energy injector of the SPring-8 storage ring since 2020. In order to perform the beam injection in parallel with XFEL operation, three accelerators are virtually constructed in a control system. Thus the electron beam parameters, such as the beam energy, are independently tuned for the beam injection and the two XFEL beamlines. By shutting down dedicated old injector accelerators, the electricity consumption has been reduced by roughly 20-30 % and its maintenance cost is no more necessary. SACLA will also provide the electron beam for the future SPring-8-II, which requires low-emittance beams for injection due to its small beam aperture. In this presentation, we summarize the beam injection scheme developed at SACLA including observed emittance increase at a beam transport caused by quantum excitation of synchrotron radiation, a synchronization system between the two accelerators, and a purification method of the electron bunch in the storage ring.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/395\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Toru","last_name":"Hara","fullName":"Hara, Toru","id":"1014","affiliation":"RIKEN SPring-8 Center","emailHash":"f28e618ef112b60d15cc71b53b3ed67b","db_id":1014,"person_id":1717}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Toru","last_name":"Hara","fullName":"Hara, Toru","id":"1014","affiliation":"RIKEN SPring-8 Center","emailHash":"f28e618ef112b60d15cc71b53b3ed67b","db_id":1014,"person_id":1717}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":"SASE FEL","session":"Monday posters","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"MOP57","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"108","db_id":487,"friendly_id":108,"title":"Corrugated Structure System for Fresh-Slice Applications at the European XFEL","startDate":{"date":"2022-08-22","time":"17:10:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2022-08-22","time":"17:30:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Exhibition Hall","room":"Exhibition Hall","note":{},"location":"Trieste Convention Centre","type":"Contributed Poster","description":"Fresh-slice lasing using wakefield induced time-dependent orbit oscillation is capable of producing high intensity two-color XFEL pulses and high power short pulses at femtosecond level.

All of the known spectral methods share the weakness that they will underestimate the pulse length in the case that the FEL spectrum is broadened due to the electron beam having an energy chirp. We present a statistical analysis of FEL radiation in the presence of a linear electron beam energy chirp which extends previous results by including an accurate description of the FEL gain process. In doing so, we show that with measurements of the spectral intensity correlations and the average spectrum, one can reconstruct the x-ray pulse length, e-beam chirp, and spectrometer resolution.

at SwissFEL. In the setup, a laser emittance spoiler pulse is overlapped with the primary photocathode laser to locally spoil the beam emittance and the FEL emission. This results, together with a chirped electron pulse, in X-ray emission at two colors. High-energy, high stability, independent control of the duration and of the intensity of the two colors is demonstrated. The laser emittance spoiler enables shot-to-shot selection between one and two-color FEL emission and further, it is compatible with high repetition-rate FELs, as it does not contribute to beam losses.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/495\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Carlo","last_name":"Vicario","fullName":"Vicario,

the harsh operational conditions due to high-energetic and background radiation in an ultra-high vacuum environment. For the wavelength between 120 and 190 nm only fluoride materials are suitable as coating material for high reflective mirrors. However, used in the bare form, they are not stable for extreme FEL operation conditions. Until this work, it was not possible to achieve the lasing below 176 nm with an oscillator FEL. The collaboration between DUKE University\/TUNL and Laser Zentrum Hannover e.V. has recently demonstrated the storage-ring FEL lasing between 169.6 and 176.7 nm. For this work, different coating techniques such as ion beam sputtering, thermal evaporation, and atomic layer deposition were employed to produce samples of a single-layer, multilayers, and a version with a protection layer. All samples were irradiated using Duke FEL undulators and characterized with VUV spectrometry from 140 to 230 nm. We have found that the $\\text{SiO}_2$-protected fluoride coatings have good thermal stability and radiation resistance. Several sets of mirrors have been coated and used to demonstrate the FEL lasing in a new VUV range with a reasonable lifetime. These mirrors have also been used to generate 120 MeV gamma rays via Compton scattering. The newly developed coating strategies are expected to enable the storage-ring FEL to operate in even shorter wavelengths.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/399\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Leif","last_name":"Kochanneck","fullName":"Kochanneck, Leif","id":"1040","affiliation":"Laser Zentrum Hannover e.V.","emailHash":"70b38117f25b3c3994c7e3b33502eb82","db_id":1040,"person_id":1243}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Leif","last_name":"Kochanneck","fullName":"Kochanneck, Leif","id":"1040","affiliation":"Laser Zentrum Hannover e.V.","emailHash":"70b38117f25b3c3994c7e3b33502eb82","db_id":1040,"person_id":1243},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Henrik","last_name":"Ehlers","fullName":"Ehlers, Henrik","id":"1041","affiliation":"Laser Zentrum Hannover e.V.; Laseroptik GmbH","emailHash":"f067a608f6f9f9a305460aa37be44d39","db_id":1041,"person_id":1245},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Lars O.","last_name":"Jensen","fullName":"Jensen, Lars O.","id":"1045","affiliation":"Laser Zentrum Hannover e.V.; Trumpf Laser SE & Co.

The hole-coupling inherently causes a non-Gaussian beam profile at user stations, which are more than 10 m apart from the coupling hole. It is due to the existence of the Airy pattern in the extracted laser beam. We demonstrated that the beam profile can be changed from a non-Gaussian to a nearly Gaussian distribution by removing the Airy pattern in the experiments and physical optics calculations [1].

A superconducting linear accelerator drives two undulator lines (FLASH1 and\r\n FLASH2). The FLASH1 undulator beam line contains six fixed gap undulator which implies that the SASE wavelength can only be changed via the electron beam energy, while FLASH2 contains twelve variable gap undulators. Preparing different charges and compression schemes to the two parts of the bunch trains for the two undulator beamlines allows to adjust the phase space in wide range and meeting the various requirements of photon pulse trains properties. In order to improve the SASE performance reference files for standard energies and standard charges are regularly prepared. In the FLASH2 undulator beamline beam-based alignment and phase shifter scans have been applied to improve SASE operations and FEL beam quality. Improving set-up and tuning procedures allow to decrease setup times and optimize performance and stability. Procedures and optimization of FEL parameters towards a reliable SASE-FEL operation as well as the achieved results are

The flexibility of the variable gap undulators in the FLASH2 beamline opens a wide range of scientific opportunities. Different advanced lasing schemes have been tested in the past years, like the ``frequency doubler`` scheme, two-color lasing, and ``harmonic lasing self-seeded FEL (HLSS)``. A recent user experiment required parameters not yet provided: a similar power in the fundamental and the third harmonic. To fulfill these requirements, a new way of lasing had to be developed ad hoc. A combination of HLSS and two-color lasing has been identified as the appropriated scheme to deliver a tailored two-color beam to the user experiment.

Oscillator simulations are done in conjunction with OPC [8]. MINERVA uses the Message Passing interface on Linux, Macintosh and Windows systems and has been successfully benchmarked against many experiments. Particle dynamics are treated using the full Lorentz force equations to track particles through the optical and magnetostatic fields. Hence, MINERVA treats both fundamental and (linear and nonlinear) harmonic generation from first principles. The optical field is a superposition of Gaussian modes using the slowly-varying envelope approximation in which the x- and y-components of the field are integrated independently, and tracks the particles and fields as they propagate along the undulator line from the start-up through linear growth and into the nonlinear regime using either 2nd or 4th order Runge-Kutta integrators. MINERVA includes 3-D descriptions of planar, helical, and elliptical undulators (including a model of an APPLE-II undulator) with the fringing fields in the entry\/exit transition regions. Magnetostatic field models for quadrupoles and dipoles are also included. As such, MINERVA implicitly simulates the evolution of the polarization of the optical field through an arbitrary sequence of undulators.

At x-ray wavelengths, FELs typically rely on self-amplified spontaneous emission SASE emission which contains multiple temporal \u201cspikes\u201d that limit the longitudinal coherence of the optical output; hence, alternate methods that improve on the longitudinal coherence of the SASE emission are of interest. In this paper, we consider electron bunches that are shorter than the SASE spike separation.1 In such cases, the spontaneously generated radiation consists of a single optical pulse with improved longitudinal coherence than is found in typical SASE FELs. To investigate this regime, we use two FEL simulation codes. One (MINERVA) uses the slowly-varying envelope approximation (SVEA) which breaks down for extremely short pulses. The second (PUFFIN) is a particle-in-cell (PiC) simulation code that is considered to be a more complete model of the underlying physics and which is able to simulate very short pulses. We first anchor these codes by showing that there is substantial agreement between the codes in simulation of the SPARC SASE FEL experiment at ENEA Frascati. We then compare the two codes for simulations using electron bunch lengths that are shorter than the SASE spike separation. The comparisons between the two codes for short bunch simulations elucidate the limitations of the SVEA in this regime but indicate that the SVEA can treat short bunches that are comparable to the cooperation length.\r\n\r\n1.

X-ray FELs depend upon long undulator lines consisting of a sequence of short undulators. Linearly polarized undulators are most commonly used; hence the optical output is linearly polarized. Elliptic or circular polarizations are possible by varying the undulator orientation. Alternately, APPLE-II or Delta undulator designs produce undulating magnetic fields with arbitrary polarizations. We present a three-dimensional, time-dependent formulation that self-consistently includes two optical orientations and, therefore, treats any given sequence or combination of undulator including undulator imperfections and degradation.1 There are two principal characteristics of the formulation that underpin this capability. First, particles are tracked using the full Newton Lorentz force equations with analytic models of the undulators fields. This permits an accurate model of the interaction of the electrons with a large variety of undulator fields and orientations. Second, the electrons can couple simultaneously to two independent electromagnetic polarizations and, therefore, the optical polarization evolves self-consistently along the undulator line. We present the numerical model and give some examples using prevailing undulator configurations.\r\n\r\n1. H.P.

Additionally, we touch on the approach to 2-color commissioning with pulse picking, as well as considerations for the far-IR optical transport to users.

The spatial encoding is achieved when a spatially tilted electron beam with a strong energy chirp is injected into a focusing-free undulator channel.

Thomson scattering, in which an electron beam colliding with a laser pulse produces radiation, is a source of X-rays of increasing prevalence in modern labs, complementing large scale facilities like synchrotrons and X-ray free electron lasers. By imposing a density modulation on the electron beam the brilliance of a Thomson source can be enhanced by orders of magnitude via superradiant emission. However, microbunching at the beam energy relevant to Thomson sources is a challenge that has yet to be met. Here, we analytically and numerically analyze electron beam modulation via the ponderomotive force from the copropagating beat wave formed by two laser pulses at different frequencies. First, we find that energy modulation favorably scales with electron beam energy, but is limited by the interaction length imposed by the finite size of the laser pulses. Next, we quantify the brightness of a Thomson source including a ponderomotive buncher that is optimized for superradiant emission. Last, we investigate under which conditions the spontaneous superradiant Thomson regime transitions into a stimulated Thomson (FEL-)regime, potentially allowing for even further increase of source brightness.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/437\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Brian","last_name":"Schaap","fullName":"Schaap, Brian","id":"1339","affiliation":"Technische Universiteit Eindhoven","emailHash":"c06198cc39b49752ca81ef1f91604c7d","db_id":1339,"person_id":1800},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Coen","last_name":"Sweers","fullName":"Sweers, Coen","id":"1341","affiliation":"Tu\/e","emailHash":"e82d3133aebee8830499cf165d929b82","db_id":1341,"person_id":1802},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Max","last_name":"van der Schans","fullName":"van der Schans, Max","id":"1342","affiliation":"TU\/e","emailHash":"58bf50649a958c3b27c5ca2fe93ed77f","db_id":1342,"person_id":1803}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Brian","last_name":"Schaap","fullName":"Schaap, Brian","id":"1339","affiliation":"Technische Universiteit Eindhoven","emailHash":"c06198cc39b49752ca81ef1f91604c7d","db_id":1339,"person_id":1800},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Coen","last_name":"Sweers","fullName":"Sweers, Coen","id":"1341","affiliation":"Tu\/e","emailHash":"e82d3133aebee8830499cf165d929b82","db_id":1341,"person_id":1802},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Max","last_name":"van der Schans","fullName":"van der Schans, Max","id":"1342","affiliation":"TU\/e","emailHash":"58bf50649a958c3b27c5ca2fe93ed77f","db_id":1342,"person_id":1803},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Sander","last_name":"Schouwenaars","fullName":"Schouwenaars, Sander","id":"1343","affiliation":"TU\/e","emailHash":"747bc3c13705329e34945dd826fe7349","db_id":1343,"person_id":1801},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Jom","last_name":"Luiten","fullName":"Luiten, Jom","id":"1340","affiliation":"Technische Universiteit Eindhoven","emailHash":"e693db5b25c403948951ad7287d07feb","db_id":1340,"person_id":1269}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":"FEL Theory","session":"Monday posters","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"MOP10","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"203","db_id":396,"friendly_id":203,"title":"Bringing Genesis to the Cloud with Sirepo","startDate":{"date":"2022-08-22","time":"17:10:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2022-08-22","time":"17:30:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Exhibition Hall","room":"Exhibition Hall","note":{},"location":"Trieste Convention Centre","type":"Contributed Poster","description":"Genesis is widely used in the free electron laser community as a simulation tool for studying both simple and complex FEL systems.

Imperative to experimental realization is allowing for decoherence of either spontaneous emission or space-charge to take place, having opposing constraints [1].  Here, for the first time, we discuss a comprehensive QFEL model that takes into account both decoherence effects. Then, we use this model to investigate the ultracold electron source (UCES) [2] as a potential QFEL electron injector. The UCES, based on near-threshold photoionization of laser-cooled and trapped atomic gas, has the unique property of allowing highly charged electron bunches to be extracted while maintaining ultralow transverse emittance. We find that the ultracold electron bunches meet the stringent requirement for potential QFEL operation with commercially available laser systems.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/448\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Brian","last_name":"Schaap","fullName":"Schaap, Brian","id":"1402","affiliation":"Technische Universiteit Eindhoven","emailHash":"c06198cc39b49752ca81ef1f91604c7d","db_id":1402,"person_id":1800},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Jom","last_name":"Luiten","fullName":"Luiten, Jom","id":"1405","affiliation":"Technische Universiteit Eindhoven","emailHash":"e693db5b25c403948951ad7287d07feb","db_id":1405,"person_id":1269},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Sander","last_name":"Schouwenaars","fullName":"Schouwenaars, Sander","id":"1401","affiliation":"Technische Universiteit Eindhoven","emailHash":"747bc3c13705329e34945dd826fe7349","db_id":1401,"person_id":1801}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Brian","last_name":"Schaap","fullName":"Schaap, Brian","id":"1402","affiliation":"Technische Universiteit Eindhoven","emailHash":"c06198cc39b49752ca81ef1f91604c7d","db_id":1402,"person_id":1800},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Jom","last_name":"Luiten","fullName":"Luiten, Jom","id":"1405","affiliation":"Technische Universiteit Eindhoven","emailHash":"e693db5b25c403948951ad7287d07feb","db_id":1405,"person_id":1269},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Sander","last_name":"Schouwenaars","fullName":"Schouwenaars, Sander","id":"1401","affiliation":"Technische Universiteit Eindhoven","emailHash":"747bc3c13705329e34945dd826fe7349","db_id":1401,"person_id":1801}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":"FEL Theory","session":"FEL Theory","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"MOCO3","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"117","db_id":357,"friendly_id":117,"title":"Quantum Diffusion Due to Coherent Radiation","startDate":{"date":"2022-08-22","time":"15:35:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2022-08-22","time":"16:00:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":25,"roomFullname":"Auditorium Generali","room":"Auditorium Generali","note":{},"location":"Trieste Convention Centre","type":"Contributed Oral","description":"Quantum diffusion is caused by the recoil effect that a particle experiences when it emits a photon [1]. Quantum diffusion due to the synchrotron radiation in high-energy electron and positron circular accelerators defines the main parameters of the beam: its energy spread and hence the bunch length, as well as the horizontal emittance. It is calculated as a single particle effect assuming incoherent radiation. This assumption is not valid in FELs where the radiation is coherent. In this work, we develop theory of the quantum diffusion in coherent radiation and show that it leads to the energy diffusion of the particles that is correlated between the different positions in the bunch.","folders":[{"_type":"folder","id":215,"title":null,"description":"","attachments":[],"default_folder":true,"is_protected":false}],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/357\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Gennady","last_name":"Stupakov","fullName":"Stupakov, Gennady","id":"675","affiliation":"SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory","emailHash":"bb40091440df4aa67667ada3c79a4b47","db_id":675,"person_id":1697}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Gennady","last_name":"Stupakov","fullName":"Stupakov, Gennady","id":"675","affiliation":"SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory","emailHash":"bb40091440df4aa67667ada3c79a4b47","db_id":675,"person_id":1697}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":"FEL Theory","session":"FEL Theory","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"MOCO4","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"186","db_id":335,"friendly_id":186,"title":"Attosecond Polarization Modulation of X-Ray Radiation in a Free-Electron Laser","startDate":{"date":"2022-08-22","time":"14:40:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2022-08-22","time":"15:10:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":30,"roomFullname":"Auditorium Generali","room":"Auditorium Generali","note":{},"location":"Trieste Convention Centre","type":"Invited Orals","description":"Polarization is a fundamental property of light used in experiments to probe various properties of matter such as the chirality of molecules and crystal structures. There is increasing interest in generating bespoke radiation pulses for experiments with increasingly complex structures of polarization. At short wavelengths, free electron lasers offer an avenue to control the polarization structure at the point where the radiation is emitted through manipulation of the electron beam, removing the requirement for polarizing optics not readily available at x-ray wavelengths. This talk discusses a method for manipulating the polarization of FEL generated light based on temporal intensity modulation of radiation emitted in orthogonally polarized undulators. Simulations demonstrate the method can produce radiation that switches between orthogonal polarization states at attosecond timescales. Implementation of this ultra-fast polarization switching would provide a valuable new tool to the scientific community.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/335\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Jenny","last_name":"Morgan","fullName":"Morgan, Jenny","id":"584","affiliation":"SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory","emailHash":"660092899ae338c1e98f172119a9d7b5","db_id":584,"person_id":1715}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Jenny","last_name":"Morgan","fullName":"Morgan, Jenny","id":"584","affiliation":"SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory","emailHash":"660092899ae338c1e98f172119a9d7b5","db_id":584,"person_id":1715}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":"FEL Theory","session":"FEL Theory","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"MOCI2","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"115","db_id":334,"friendly_id":115,"title":"Population Inversion X-Ray Laser Oscillator at LCLS","startDate":{"date":"2022-08-22","time":"14:10:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2022-08-22","time":"14:40:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":30,"roomFullname":"Auditorium Generali","room":"Auditorium Generali","note":{},"location":"Trieste Convention Centre","type":"Invited Orals","description":"Cavity-based XFEL systems will potentially offer much higher spectral quality of the hard x-ray beam compared to traditional XFEL SASE and self-seeded sources. A promising cavity-based concept is the population inversion x-ray laser oscillator, dubbed XLO, where the SASE beam is used as a pump, and a transition metal serves as a gain medium. We will report on the progress in design and construction of the XLO, using LCLS as an x-ray pump, being developed by a SLAC, CFEL, University of Hamburg, University of Wisconsin, and UCLA collaboration. Initially, XLO will be demonstrated at the Coherent X-ray Imaging (CXI) LCLS end-station, as a two pass Regenerative Amplifier operating at the Copper Kalpha1 photon energy of 8048 eV. In the later phase of the project, it will utilize LCLS multi-bunch mode, with up to 8 x-ray pulses.   Finally, XLO will generate fully coherent transform limited pulses with about 50 meV FWHM bandwidth. We expect the XLO will pave the way for new user experiments, e.g. in inelastic X-ray scattering, parametric down conversion, quantum science, X-ray interferometry.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/334\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Aliaksei","last_name":"Halavanau","fullName":"Halavanau, Aliaksei","id":"578","affiliation":"SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory","emailHash":"0e9cb8a87d6062884638caa2ce0c2acc","db_id":578,"person_id":1523}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Aliaksei","last_name":"Halavanau","fullName":"Halavanau, Aliaksei","id":"578","affiliation":"SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory","emailHash":"0e9cb8a87d6062884638caa2ce0c2acc","db_id":578,"person_id":1523},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Andrei","last_name":"Benediktovitch","fullName":"Benediktovitch, Andrei","id":"574","affiliation":"CFEL, DESY","emailHash":null,"db_id":574,"person_id":1692},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Claudio","last_name":"Pellegrini","fullName":"Pellegrini, Claudio","id":"572","affiliation":"SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory","emailHash":null,"db_id":572,"person_id":1689},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"James","last_name":"Rosenzweig","fullName":"Rosenzweig, James","id":"583","affiliation":"University of California -

Benefiting from the superiority of low sensitivity to the electron beam imperfections and flexible output pulse control of EEHC, nearly transform-limited soft X-ray pulses with tunable pulse durations have been successfully generated. These experiments exceed the current limitations of external seeding techniques and may open up new opportunities for extending external seeded FEL to shorter wavelength range.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/338\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Chao","last_name":"Feng","fullName":"Feng, Chao","id":"601","affiliation":"Shanghai Advanced Research Institute","emailHash":"d6abf5c5ad8355374514c841aaa9b543","db_id":601,"person_id":1440}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Chao","last_name":"Feng","fullName":"Feng, Chao","id":"601","affiliation":"Shanghai Advanced Research Institute","emailHash":"d6abf5c5ad8355374514c841aaa9b543","db_id":601,"person_id":1440}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":"Seeded FEL","session":"Seeded FELs","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"TUBI1","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"32","db_id":360,"friendly_id":32,"title":"First Observation of Laser-Beam Interaction in a Dipole Magnet","startDate":{"date":"2022-08-23","time":"12:20:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2022-08-23","time":"12:45:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":25,"roomFullname":"Auditorium Generali","room":"Auditorium Generali","note":{},"location":"Trieste Convention Centre","type":"Contributed Oral","description":"Recently, a self-modulation scheme was proposed and experimentally demonstrated for enhancing energy modulation in seeded FELs [1], thereby significantly reducing the requirement of an external laser system. Driven by this scheme, an electron beam with a laser-induced energy modulation as small as 1.8 times the slice energy spread is used for lasing at the 7th harmonic of a 266-nm seed laser in a single-stage high-gain harmonic generation (HGHG) setup and the 30th harmonic of the seed laser in a two-stage HGHG setup. Moreover, using this scheme, we report the first observation of the laser-beam interaction in a pure dipole magnet [2] in which the electron beam energy modulation with a 40-keV amplitude and a 266-nm period is measured. We demonstrate that such an energy modulation can be used to launch a seeded FEL, that is, lasing at the sixth harmonic of the seed laser in a high-gain harmonic generation scheme. The results reveal the most basic process of the FEL lasing and open up a new direction for the study and exploitation of laser-beam interactions.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/360\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Jiawei","last_name":"Yan","fullName":"Yan, Jiawei","id":"704","affiliation":"European XFEL GmbH","emailHash":"de4f0791757caec4a3d4f0f063c0e8a5","db_id":704,"person_id":1192}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Jiawei","last_name":"Yan","fullName":"Yan, Jiawei","id":"704","affiliation":"European XFEL GmbH","emailHash":"de4f0791757caec4a3d4f0f063c0e8a5","db_id":704,"person_id":1192},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Haixiao","last_name":"Deng","fullName":"Deng, Haixiao","id":"702","affiliation":"Shanghai Advanced Research Institute Chinese Academy of Science","emailHash":"2b3c12e717d08134e0dc1fda35ab2a4d","db_id":702,"person_id":1193},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Zhentang","last_name":"Zhao","fullName":"Zhao, Zhentang","id":"703","affiliation":"Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility","emailHash":"191aca9b421c08de9c2070bdbb69454c","db_id":703,"person_id":1231}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":"Seeded FEL","session":"Seeded FELs","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"TUBO4","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"39","db_id":339,"friendly_id":39,"title":"Enhanced Self-Seeding with Ultrashort Electron Beams","startDate":{"date":"2022-08-23","time":"11:30:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2022-08-23","time":"11:55:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":25,"roomFullname":"Auditorium Generali","room":"Auditorium Generali","note":{},"location":"Trieste Convention Centre","type":"Invited Orals","description":"We describe a new method to produce intensity stable, highly coherent, narrow-band x-ray pulses in self-seeded free electron (FEL) lasers. The approach uses an ultrashort electron beam to generate a single spike FEL pulse with a wide coherent bandwidth. The self-seeding monochromator then notches out a narrow spectral region of this pulse to be amplified by a long portion of electron beam to full saturation. In contrast to typical self-seeding where monochromatization of noisy self-amplified spontaneous emission pulses leads to either large intensity fluctuations or multiple frequencies, we show that this method produces a stable, coherent FEL output pulse with statistical properties similar to a fully coherent optical laser. With self-consistent, start-to-end simulations we show that laser heater shaping and cathode shaping techniques both can produce the electron beam current profile needed for the enhanced self-seeding scheme.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/339\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Zhen","last_name":"Zhang","fullName":"Zhang, Zhen","id":"604","affiliation":"SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory","emailHash":"ce9fb69fe0f678aeb1a75fa4a6a4ff39","db_id":604,"person_id":1184},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Erik","last_name":"Hemsing","fullName":"Hemsing, Erik","id":"602","affiliation":"SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory","emailHash":"eec8268bb9bb5d9959bdf1fe6943a5db","db_id":602,"person_id":1255},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Aliaksei","last_name":"Halavanau","fullName":"Halavanau, Aliaksei","id":"603","affiliation":"SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory","emailHash":"0e9cb8a87d6062884638caa2ce0c2acc","db_id":603,"person_id":1523}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Zhen","last_name":"Zhang","fullName":"Zhang, Zhen","id":"604","affiliation":"SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory","emailHash":"ce9fb69fe0f678aeb1a75fa4a6a4ff39","db_id":604,"person_id":1184}],"coauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Erik","last_name":"Hemsing","fullName":"Hemsing, Erik","id":"602","affiliation":"SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory","emailHash":"eec8268bb9bb5d9959bdf1fe6943a5db","db_id":602,"person_id":1255},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Aliaksei","last_name":"Halavanau","fullName":"Halavanau, Aliaksei","id":"603","affiliation":"SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory","emailHash":"0e9cb8a87d6062884638caa2ce0c2acc","db_id":603,"person_id":1523}],"keywords":[],"track":"Seeded FEL","session":"Seeded FELs","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"TUBI2","subContributions":[]}],"note":{},"session":{"folders":[],"startDate":{"date":"2022-08-23","time":"11:00:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2022-08-23","time":"12:50:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"_type":"Session","sessionConveners":[{"fax":"","familyName":"Hajima","firstName":"Ryoichi","name":"Hajima, Ryoichi","last_name":"Hajima","first_name":"Ryoichi","title":"","_type":"SlotChair","affiliation":"National Institutes for Quantum Science and Technology","_fossil":"conferenceParticipation","fullName":"Hajima, Ryoichi","id":1472,"db_id":7,"person_id":1472,"emailHash":"cf5832c0287428f7395832956645c8f5"}],"title":"Seeded FELs","color":"#5f171a","textColor":"#ffffff","description":"","material":[],"isPoster":false,"type":null,"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/sessions\/110\/","roomFullname":"Auditorium Generali","location":"Trieste Convention Centre","address":"viale Miramare, 24\/2\nTrieste -

The performances of this dual source are illustrated by means of dedicated simulations assessing the capability of the scheme for typical wavelengths of interest, namely up to 50 \u00b5m for the

Free-electron laser coupling in a magnetic undulator can provide radiation generation in this frequency range, but slippage effects require the use of relatively long and low current electron bunches in the THz FEL, limiting the amplification gain and output peak power. We show how a circular waveguide in a meter-long strongly tapered helical undulator can be used to match the radiation and e-beam velocities, extracting energy from an ultrashort 200 pC 5.5 MeV electron beam along the entire undulator. E-beam spectrum measurements, supported by energy and spectral measurements of the THz FEL radiation, indicate an average energy efficiency of 10% with some particles losing >20% of their initial kinetic energy.","folders":[{"_type":"folder","id":222,"title":null,"description":"","attachments":[{"_type":"attachment","id":739,"download_url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/362\/attachments\/222\/739\/TUCO3_slides.pptx","title":"TUCO3_slides.pptx","description":"","modified_dt":"2022-08-22T08:51:21.650923+00:00","type":"file","is_protected":false,"filename":"TUCO3_slides.pptx","content_type":"application\/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.presentationml.presentation","size":19788175,"checksum":"e3e73eb9bee75718ede506cea7dc9fe3"}],"default_folder":true,"is_protected":false}],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/362\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Andrew","last_name":"Fisher","fullName":"Fisher, Andrew","id":"712","affiliation":"University of California, Los Angeles","emailHash":"370c9b8597741a510ed639a7e8196caa","db_id":712,"person_id":1514},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Pietro","last_name":"Musumeci","fullName":"Musumeci, Pietro","id":"711","affiliation":"University of California, Los Angeles","emailHash":"ffe6745ab3dbfbb84ee29d263aa15780","db_id":711,"person_id":1512}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Andrew","last_name":"Fisher","fullName":"Fisher, Andrew","id":"712","affiliation":"University of California, Los Angeles","emailHash":"370c9b8597741a510ed639a7e8196caa","db_id":712,"person_id":1514},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Pietro","last_name":"Musumeci","fullName":"Musumeci, Pietro","id":"711","affiliation":"University of California, Los Angeles","emailHash":"ffe6745ab3dbfbb84ee29d263aa15780","db_id":711,"person_id":1512}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":"FEL oscillators & IR-FEL","session":"FEL Oscillators and IRFELs","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"TUCO3","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"33","db_id":341,"friendly_id":33,"title":"FEL Lasing below 170 nm Using an Oscillator","startDate":{"date":"2022-08-23","time":"14:40:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2022-08-23","time":"15:10:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":30,"roomFullname":"Auditorium Generali","room":"Auditorium Generali","note":{},"location":"Trieste Convention Centre","type":"Invited Orals","description":"While the linac based single-pass FEL has been successfully operated\r\nin the EUV and x-ray regions for about two decades, the oscillator\r\nFEL has been limited to operating in the longer wavelength region\r\ndue to the limitation of high-reflectivity, thermally stable, and \r\nradiation-resistant short-wavelength mirrors.

Because of the interaction between the electron beam and FEL electromagnetic field, a maximum electron energy decrease of 16% was observed. The measured energy decrease was consistent with the measured FEL spectrum. The FEL pulse structure under the high extraction efficiency operation was obtained by a phase retrieval based on the result of fringe resolved autocorrelation measurement [3]. As the result, it was confirmed that the FEL pulse has several sub-spikes after the main spike having a 4.2-cycle pulse length at the wavelength of 11 $\\mu$m. Moreover, the neighboring spikes has 180-degree different optical phases, i.e. $\\pi$-phase jumps. The appearance of the sub-spikes and the $\\pi$-phase jumps are the specific feature of the Burnham-Chiao ringing (or Superradiance ringing) [4], which has been predicted by numerical simulations [5] but not yet fully characterized in experiments. The ringing and the $\\pi$-phase jumps are clear evidence of the periodic acceleration and deceleration of the microbunched electrons. In this talk, we present an overview of few-cycle FEL lasing with the high extraction efficiency, >9%, and the details of FEL pulse measurements to reveal the Burnham-Chiao ringing.

The laser shaping is done at 1030 nm with spatial light modulators, and then converted to 257.5 nm through harmonic generation for photoemission. Experimental results of laser pulse shaping and shape preservation through harmonic generation are presented for different cases: spatial shaping, temporal shaping and full 3D shaping.

This contribution presents measurements of the energy spread at the SwissFEL injector as a function of the electron bunch charge, the optics and the longitudinal dispersion of the lattice. The results indicate that both intra-beam scattering and micro-bunching, not covered in the conventional modeling of injectors, cause a blow-up of the energy spread. The work underlines the importance of considering the energy spread in the optimization and design of high-brightness electron beam sources and the need to develop new models to adequately understand

accelerators is the microbunching instability driven by longitudinal wake fields along the accelerator.  Over the last decades a tremendous effort has been made in the theoretical understanding and experimental study of the microbunching instability impact on free electron laser performances. At the European XFEL, the compression of the electron beam to high peak current is achieved through three bunch compressors. Normally, the compression factor is more than 100, resulting in around 25 fs RMS bunch length. This high compression factor transfers the microbunching wavelengths to the visible or (very) near infrared radiation wavelength.  In this presentation, we discuss our recent MBI study and measurements in European XFEL. By using the matrix model for collective space charge and coherent synchrotron radiation phenomena in electron beam longitudinal phase space and considering existing theories of intera beam scattering, in single pass linacs and multi-bend transfer lines [1], we theoretically characterize the MBI after each bunch compressor at European XFEL machine. We verify our theoretical prediction with longitudinal phase space and FEL radiation measurement.  \r\n\r\n[1] G. Pasao, S.

In particular, it is important that all physically relevant collective effects are adequately represented in simulation codes so that their influence on the phase-space evolution of the bunch can be calculated with sufficient accuracy at all relevant length scales.  Besides coherent collective effects such as space charge or coherent radiative interaction also incoherent effects such as intra-beam scattering are suspected to have a significant impact on the efficacy of sophisticated lasing techniques.\r\nMost of the well-known and widely-used beam dynamics codes employ the Lagrangian approach, in which the particle bunch is represented by discrete points in phase-space and track the solutions of their equations of motion.  In contrast to that, in the Eulerian and semi-Lagrangian approach, the bunch is described by a numerical representation of its phase-space density function.\r\nThis contribution discusses the working principles of the three classes of simulation methods Lagrangian, Eulerian, and semi-Lagrangian and highlights their respective advantages and short-comings, when applied to the simulation of collective beam dynamics in FELs.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/344\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Philipp","last_name":"Amstutz","fullName":"Amstutz, Philipp","id":"621","affiliation":"Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron","emailHash":"adf5248e2b29f64c5903a0914d697d16","db_id":621,"person_id":1506}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Philipp","last_name":"Amstutz","fullName":"Amstutz, Philipp","id":"621","affiliation":"Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron","emailHash":"adf5248e2b29f64c5903a0914d697d16","db_id":621,"person_id":1506}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":"Electron beam dynamics","session":"Electron beam dynamics","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"WEBI1","subContributions":[]}],"note":{},"session":{"folders":[],"startDate":{"date":"2022-08-24","time":"11:00:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2022-08-24","time":"12:50:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"_type":"Session","sessionConveners":[{"fax":"","familyName":"Thorin","firstName":"Sara","name":"Thorin, Sara","last_name":"Thorin","first_name":"Sara","title":"","_type":"SlotChair","affiliation":"MAX IV Laboratory","_fossil":"conferenceParticipation","fullName":"Thorin, Sara","id":1253,"db_id":10,"person_id":1253,"emailHash":"a390b1109239bdb4876cfc41aee48418"}],"title":"Electron beam dynamics","color":"#5f171a","textColor":"#ffffff","description":"","material":[],"isPoster":false,"type":null,"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/sessions\/113\/","roomFullname":"Auditorium Generali","location":"Trieste Convention Centre","address":"viale Miramare, 24\/2\nTrieste -

The experiment was performed at HZDR (Germany), coupling the high quality electron beams of the HZDR laser plasma accelerator with the versatile COXINEL beam manipulation line. Using an external seed at 270 nm, the FEL signal was observed at 275 nm. We explain how this slight red-shift confirms previous predictions [1], show the precise control over the FEL wavelength and give evidence of the longitudinal coherence of the emitted pulses. All experimental results are strongly supported by analytic modeling and Genesis numerical simulations. Our results substantiate the continuous progress of LPA technology to enable FEL operation and finally bring temporal coherence to those compact promising sources.\r\n[1] M Labat et al 2020 New J.

density electron beams as only produced at dedicated single pass or recirculating linear accelerators. We describe new conceptual, technical, and modeling solutions to produce subpicosecond, up to \u223c100 \u03bcJ-energy extreme ultra-violet and soft x-ray FEL pulses at high and tunable repetition rates, from a diffraction-limited storage ring light source. In contrast to previously proposed schemes, we show that lasing can be simultaneous to the standard multibunch radiation emission from short insertion devices, and that it can be obtained with limited impact on the storage ring infrastructure. By virtue of the high-average power but moderate pulse energy, the storage ring-driven high-gain FEL would open the door to unprecedented accuracy in timeresolved spectroscopic analysis of matter in the linear response regime, in addition to inelastic scattering experiments.","folders":[{"_type":"folder","id":209,"title":null,"description":"","attachments":[],"default_folder":true,"is_protected":false}],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/368\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Simone","last_name":"Di Mitri","fullName":"Di Mitri, Simone","id":"791","affiliation":"Elettra-Sincrotrone Trieste S.C.p.A.","emailHash":"04a73bfcde6c346288ea012239f50fe1","db_id":791,"person_id":450}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Simone","last_name":"Di Mitri","fullName":"Di Mitri, Simone","id":"791","affiliation":"Elettra-Sincrotrone Trieste S.C.p.A.","emailHash":"04a73bfcde6c346288ea012239f50fe1","db_id":791,"person_id":450},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Massimo","last_name":"Cornacchia","fullName":"Cornacchia, Massimo","id":"787","affiliation":"Elettra Sincortrone Trieste (retired)","emailHash":"b75cd76b1c8ea47d089b0b0dbe43aa96","db_id":787,"person_id":1133},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Filippo","last_name":"Sottocorona","fullName":"Sottocorona, Filippo","id":"792","affiliation":"University of Trieste, Elettra Sincrotrone Trieste","emailHash":"29328aa2c903014f717a023fcc299143","db_id":792,"person_id":1134},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Giovanni","last_name":"Perosa","fullName":"Perosa, Giovanni","id":"790","affiliation":"University of Trieste, Elettra Sincrotrone Trieste","emailHash":"ad53955ce8eaaefab72d84a47dd5e3e2","db_id":790,"person_id":1132},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Bruno","last_name":"Diviacco","fullName":"Diviacco, Bruno","id":"789","affiliation":"Elettra-Sincrotrone Trieste S.C.p.A.","emailHash":"d247d5abf6ec6449754594d2048e3f8f","db_id":789,"person_id":1135},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Simone","last_name":"Spampinati","fullName":"Spampinati, Simone","id":"788","affiliation":"Elettra-Sincrotrone Trieste S.C.p.A.","emailHash":"e7804e6bf3a7add26c3631ad7f452ef9","db_id":788,"person_id":1136}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":"Novel acceleration and FEL concepts","session":"Novel acceleration and FEL concepts","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"WECO4","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"232","db_id":333,"friendly_id":232,"title":"Free-electron Lasing Based on a  Laser Wakefield Accelerator","startDate":{"date":"2022-08-24","time":"14:10:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2022-08-24","time":"14:40:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":30,"roomFullname":"Auditorium Generali","room":"Auditorium Generali","note":{},"location":"Trieste Convention Centre","type":"Invited Orals","description":"Laser wakefield accelerators can sustain accelerating gradients more than three orders of magnitude higher than those of radio-frequency accelerators, and are regarded as an attractive option for driving compact X-ray free-electron lasers. However, the realization of such devices remains a challenge owing to the relatively poor quality of electron beams that are based on a laser wakefield accelerator. After ten years of efforts, we present an experimental demonstration of undulator radiation amplification in the exponential-gain regime by using electron beams based on a laser wakefield accelerator. The amplified undulator radiation, which is typically centred at 27 nanometres and has a maximum photon number of around 1010 per shot, yields a maximum radiation energy of about 150 nanojoules. The results constitute a proof-of-principle demonstration of free-electron lasing using a laser wakefield accelerator, and pave the way towards the development of compact X-ray free-electron lasers based on this technology with broad applications. In future, a laboratory-scale, ultra-brilliant FEL (around 10 m in size), with the advantages of low cost (~US$5 million), high temporal resolution (femtosecond-level), high resolution (nanometre-level), and ultra-high precision timing control (less than 1 fs), could gain popularity.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/333\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Wentao","last_name":"Wang","fullName":"Wang,

compact (3 cm) plasma accelerator. The accelerated beams are characterized in the six-dimensional phase-space and have a quality, comparable with state-of-the-art accelerators. This allowed the observation of amplified SASE radiation in the infrared range with typical pulse energy exponential growth, reaching tens of nJ over six consecutive undulators.\r\n\r\nOn the basis of these first amplification results starting from spontaneous emission (SASE), we upgraded the setup by seeding the amplifier with an external laser. Compared to SASE, the seeded FEL pulses are characterized by a higher pulse energy, two orders of magnitude larger (up to about 1 uJ) and an enhanced reproducibility (up to about 90%) resulting in a higher shot-to-shot stability.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/346\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Mario","last_name":"Galletti","fullName":"Galletti, Mario","id":"623","affiliation":"Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare","emailHash":"5c8e08a76a9c1891f6ac07eb3c45952f","db_id":623,"person_id":1261}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Mario","last_name":"Galletti","fullName":"Galletti, Mario","id":"623","affiliation":"Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare","emailHash":"5c8e08a76a9c1891f6ac07eb3c45952f","db_id":623,"person_id":1261}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":"Novel acceleration and FEL concepts","session":"Novel acceleration and FEL concepts","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"WECI2","subContributions":[]}],"note":{},"session":{"folders":[],"startDate":{"date":"2022-08-24","time":"14:10:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2022-08-24","time":"16:00:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"_type":"Session","sessionConveners":[{"fax":"","familyName":"Ghaith","firstName":"Amin","name":"Ghaith, Amin","last_name":"Ghaith","first_name":"Amin","title":"","_type":"SlotChair","affiliation":"Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf","_fossil":"conferenceParticipation","fullName":"Ghaith, Amin","id":1897,"db_id":18,"person_id":1897,"emailHash":"b536a7048d68825d9bf6976a55b4da9d"}],"title":"Novel acceleration and FEL concepts","color":"#5f171a","textColor":"#ffffff","description":"","material":[],"isPoster":false,"type":null,"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/sessions\/114\/","roomFullname":"Auditorium Generali","location":"Trieste Convention Centre","address":"viale Miramare, 24\/2\nTrieste -

VD is a computational tool based on deep learning that can be used to predict a diagnostic output. VDs are especially useful in systems where measuring the output is invasive, limited, costly or runs the risk of altering the output. We show a few applications (experimental or simulated data) for high repetition-rate machine (LCLS-II) or a high-current, ultra-short bunch facility (FACET-II). Then, given a prediction, we relay how reliable that prediction is, i.e., quantify the uncertainty of the prediction.

The timing jitter is, at best, one order of magnitude larger that the pulse duration. This can be handled by high precision pump-probe delay measurements and data sorting. However, only a small fraction of the pulses will be in the relevant time window.\r\n\r\nThe acceleration and compression in non-linear achromat bunch compressors enables cancellation of the energy and timing jitter caused by modulator high voltage (HV) ripple.\r\nThe cancellation works at a specific off-crest acceleration phase, the so-called magic angle.\r\nWe present experimental data showing the current performance at the MAX IV linac, and the benefit of operating at the magic angle.\r\n\r\nAnother major contribution to energy and arrival time jitter is lasers, both for the electron guns and the experiment, and how they are synchronized to the reference RF field. The RF distribution can either be optical or electrical.\r\nBy extracting the reference RF directly from the gun laser, we have eliminated the relative jitter between the gun laser pulses and the reference field. We show data of the improved performance in our optical master oscillator scheme.\r\nA full synchronization system that includes the experimental lasers is under development.\r\nOur current plan is to base the synchronization system on a continuous wave reference laser to take advantage of the high frequency of optical waves, instead of relying on the envelope of pulsed lasers.\r\n\r\nCombining acceleration at or around the magic angle with the high-precision synchronization system we aim at a timing jitter on the order of 1 fs at the end of the

allowed them to drive free-electron lasers [1]. This is a significant accomplishment as LWFA electron beams are not as well controlled as beams from conventional accelerators. However, longitudinal structure in LWFA beams could be harnessed to accelerate the self-amplified spontaneous emission (SASE) process. Pre-bunched beams have been shown to achieve gain  with shorter saturation length than conventional beams [2]. Because of the nature of the LWFA process, electron beams from LWFAs emerge from the plasma with preformed microstructures. The parameters of the accelerator dictate the shape, size and coherence of these features.  Coherent optical transition radiation (COTR) can diagnose features in microbunched portions of the electron beam.  We present experimental results across three different LWFA regimes demonstrating extreme visible microbunching (up to 10%), as well as sub mm-mrad emittance substructures in LWFA electron beams.  In each regime we examined the near field COTR at eight different wavelengths from a foil directly after the end of the accelerator. Depending on the LWFA operating regime, we observe different levels of bunch substructure. How this structure evolves across optical wavelengths is also LWFA-regime dependent. The COTR point spread function model enables the annular shapes observed in the near field to be remapped as the actual 2D beam distributions [3]. We have also used COTR interferometry to measure sub mm-mrad divergence of the microbunched portion of the beam.  In addition, we employed a multi-octave spectrometer to measure the spatially averaged TR spectrum from IR to near-UV wavelengths to characterize longitudinal beam shape. Wavelength-dependent variations in the size and radial distribution of the TR images can be correlated with features in the reconstructed longitudinal profile. Combining the longitudinal information acquired by the multi-octave spectrometer with multi-wavelength images of the foil, we observe features in the 3D beam that are unresolvable using other techniques. Moreover, with the aid of physically reasonable assumptions about the bunch profile, reconstructions of the 3D electron bunch distribution will be presented.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/347\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Alex","last_name":"Lumpkin","fullName":"Lumpkin,

In this contribution we present FEL power profile measurements with femtosecond resolution at SwissFEL.  The FEL temporal profiles are obtained from the longitudinal phase-space of the electrons after the undulator section. We use the transverse wakefields of a corrugated structure to horizontally streak the electron beam, and vertical dispersion to access the energy information. The advantages of this approach, in comparison to the standard streaking using transverse deflecting rf structures, are cost-effectiveness and stability against arrival time jitter.","folders":[{"_type":"folder","id":225,"title":null,"description":"","attachments":[],"default_folder":true,"is_protected":false}],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/370\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Philipp","last_name":"Dijkstal","fullName":"Dijkstal, Philipp","id":"853","affiliation":"Paul Scherrer Institut","emailHash":"28fc1d3893bf2c91737c840e17856a7f","db_id":853,"person_id":1589},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Alexander","last_name":"Malyzhenkov","fullName":"Malyzhenkov, Alexander","id":"847","affiliation":"Los Alamos National Laboratory","emailHash":"30137b8305f0eb107cc78d9bf944e991","db_id":847,"person_id":1588},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Sven","last_name":"Reiche","fullName":"Reiche, Sven","id":"849","affiliation":"PSI","emailHash":null,"db_id":849,"person_id":1195},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Eduard","last_name":"Prat","fullName":"Prat, Eduard","id":"851","affiliation":"Paul Scherrer Institut","emailHash":null,"db_id":851,"person_id":1482}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Philipp","last_name":"Dijkstal","fullName":"Dijkstal, Philipp","id":"853","affiliation":"Paul Scherrer Institut","emailHash":"28fc1d3893bf2c91737c840e17856a7f","db_id":853,"person_id":1589},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Alexander","last_name":"Malyzhenkov","fullName":"Malyzhenkov, Alexander","id":"847","affiliation":"Los Alamos National Laboratory","emailHash":"30137b8305f0eb107cc78d9bf944e991","db_id":847,"person_id":1588},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Sven","last_name":"Reiche","fullName":"Reiche, Sven","id":"849","affiliation":"PSI","emailHash":null,"db_id":849,"person_id":1195},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Eduard","last_name":"Prat","fullName":"Prat, Eduard","id":"851","affiliation":"Paul Scherrer Institut","emailHash":null,"db_id":851,"person_id":1482}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":"Electron diagnostics, timing, synchronization & controls","session":"Electron diagnostics, timing, synchronization & controls","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"THAO3","subContributions":[]}],"note":{},"session":{"folders":[],"startDate":{"date":"2022-08-25","time":"08:45:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2022-08-25","time":"10:35:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"_type":"Session","sessionConveners":[{"fax":"","familyName":"Labat","firstName":"Marie","name":"Labat, Marie","last_name":"Labat","first_name":"Marie","title":"","_type":"SlotChair","affiliation":"Synchrotron Soleil","_fossil":"conferenceParticipation","fullName":"Labat, Marie","id":1746,"db_id":11,"person_id":1746,"emailHash":"d993fa82eaaf780bf0c9efa37b86bed2"}],"title":"Electron diagnostics, timing, synchronization & controls","color":"#5f171a","textColor":"#ffffff","description":"","material":[],"isPoster":false,"type":null,"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/sessions\/116\/","roomFullname":"Auditorium Generali","location":"Trieste Convention Centre","address":"viale Miramare, 24\/2\nTrieste -

Specifically, the advent of FELs light sources has recently allowed to perform, in a time-resolved fashion approach, both established spectroscopies, daily employed at synchrotron light sources, and novel non-linear optical methods, mostly combining FELs and laser pulses. Nonetheless, the next step to push the ultrafast X-Ray science standards is widely recognized to be linked to go beyond the current time-resolved schemes, so performing experiments engaging exclusively EUV, SXR and HXR pulses. Indeed, exciting (and probing) matter at its (or nearby) electronic resonance is largely speculated to be one of the key for discriminating and revealing the microscopic mechanisms hiding behind some of the most exotic phases of physical, chemical, and biological systems. Such a challenge calls the design of optical devices capable to both split and delay (in time) FELs pulses, without impacting on their coherence properties, and fully user-friendly in terms of preserving the perfect overlap of the resulting focal spots, even in the few microns spatial domain, a well-known trademark for focusing EUV, SXR and HXR pulses at FELs light sources [2]. \r\nAt the seeded FERMI FEL (Trieste, Italy) this goal is committed by the novel optical device known as AC\/DC, which stands for the Auto Correlator\/Delay Creator. AC\/DC is purposely designed to double the incoming FEL photon beam into two exact pulse replicas, splitting it by inserting a grazing incidence flat mirror, and further delaying in time, in a controlled way, one of the two pulses, with an intrinsic temporal resolution of approximately 360 attoseconds. A detailed description of AC\/DC is highlighted here. Specifically, strong emphasis is dedicated to the opto-mechanical design and the laser-based feedback system, purposely designed and implemented to compensate in real-time any potential drift and pointing mismatch affecting the FEL optical trajectory, ascribable to both mechanical imperfections and residual paraxial errors appearing during a temporal delay scan [3].\r\n\r\n[1] Bostedt C., Boutet S., Fritz D.M., Huang Z., Lee H.J., Lemke H.T., Robert A., Schlotter W.F., Turner J.J., Williams G.J., Linac Coherent Light Source: The first five years.

cavity formed by crystal mirrors such that X-ray pulses receive periodic FEL-amplification and Bragg-monochromatization. CBXFELs enable improved longitudinal coherence and spectral brightness over single-pass self-amplification of spontaneous radiation (SASE) FELs [1,2] for high-repetition rate FELs. Construction and alignment of a stable low-loss cavity of Bragg-reflecting mirrors has been considered a daunting challenge and has not seen previous experimental implementation of large X-ray cavities in the hard X-ray regime. In this work, we demonstrate stable operation of a low loss 14-m-roundtrip rectangular cavity of four Bragg-reflecting diamond (400) mirrors. 9.831 keV X-rays from the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) were in-coupled into the cavity via a thin diamond transmission grating. X-ray ring-down was characterized using fast photodiodes and a nanosecond-gated camera. Intra-cavity focusing was introduced to further stabilize the cavity, enabling observation of X-ray storage at >50 round trips. This experiment demonstrates feasibility of a stable low-loss hard X-ray cavity that will support future CBXFEL tests and operation

a number of novel X-ray photon research paths. At SPring-8 Angstrom Compact Free-Electron Laser (SACLA) [1], the XFEL pulses with high stability and short pulse duration (6-7 fs) have been regularly provided thanks to the unique electron gun, accelerator, and undulator systems [2]. By focusing these XFELs to 1um-100nm, the peak intensity has been dramatically increased and new phenomena in hard X-ray nonlinear optics have been explored, such as observation of saturable absorption [3], two-photon absorption [4], and the atomic inner-shell laser emission [5]. To further promote the study in the ultra-intense X-ray laser field, we have developed a focusing system that achieves sub-10nm spot size and 10<sup>22<\/sup> W\/cm<sup>2<\/sup> intensity.\r\nFor the sub-10 nm focusing optics, an advanced Kirkpatrick-Baez (AKB) mirror system based on Wolter-type III geometry [6] has been adopted. The AKB consisting of one-dimensional Wolter mirrors can satisfy Abbe\u2019s sine condition, which leads to a reduced coma aberration and a high tolerance to the incident angle error. We have designed and developed the AKB mirror system for SACLA BL3-EH4c at a photon energy of 9.1 keV. One of the remarkable challenges for the development was the fabrication of the mirrors with 1-nm accuracy. We applied an X-ray wavefront correction scheme [7] for the precise fabrication, and achieved wavefront accuracy of \u03bb\/15 rms which satisfies Mar\u00e9chal\u2019s criterion. Ptychographic probe measurements revealed the focusing spot size of 6.6 nm (horizontal) \u00d7 7.1 nm (vertical), indicating eventually attained focused intensity of 1.21 \u00d7 10<sup>22<\/sup> W\/cm<sup>2<\/sup>.\r\nReferences: \r\n[1] T.

by near-infrared pulses at 1.55 eV - in the case of the insulating sub-system. Conversely, the metallic sub-system displays a relaxation dynamics which depends on the energy of photo-excitation. \r\nMoreover, excitation of the CDW amplitude mode is recorded only for excitation at low-photon-energy. This fact suggests that the coupling of light to ordered states of matter can predominantly be achieved when directly injecting delocalized carriers in the valence band, rather than localized excitations in the core levels. \r\nOn a complementary side, table-top experiments allow us to prove the quasi-unidirectional nature of the CDW phase in (TaSe$_4$)$_2$I, whose fingerprints are detected along its $c$-axis only. \r\nOur results provide new insights on the symmetry of the ordered phase of (TaSe$_4$)$_2$I perturbed by a selective excitation, and suggest a novel approach based on complementary table-top and FEL spectroscopies for the study of complex materials.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/374\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Federico","last_name":"Cilento","fullName":"Cilento, Federico","id":"890","affiliation":"Elettra-Sincrotrone Trieste S.C.p.A.","emailHash":"02ab7c754818357209000c5fa392ca41","db_id":890,"person_id":1626},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Wibke","last_name":"Bronsch","fullName":"Bronsch, Wibke","id":"894","affiliation":"Elettra -

With the FLASH2020+ upgrade project, the pump-probe capabilities of the FLASH will be extended. Besides offering fixed wavelengths (1030 nm fundamental and its harmonics), tunable wavelengths are under development: sub-150 fs long tunable mid-infrared (2-5 microns) pulses for the solid-state community and sub-40 fs long tunable UV-VIS (200-500 nm) pulses for the general chemistry, atomic molecular and optical physics (AMO) communities. The optical pulses will be fully synchronized with the FEL pulses and are generated with up to a 1 MHz repetition rate in bursts of 0.6 ms in length at 10 Hz. Since we are limited by our pump-lasers available fixed average power, we can also reduce the repetition rate to 200kHz or less for delivering higher energy pulses for experiments using small density targets (such as gas phases or clusters). \r\nHere, we present our pump-probe laser concept: from the laser front end to the beam delivery to experimental end-stations and instruments. We would be happy to receive any feedback from the users on their needs so we can adjust our concept as needed.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/375\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Skirmantas","last_name":"Alisauskas","fullName":"Alisauskas, Skirmantas","id":"905","affiliation":"Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron DESY","emailHash":"a1c6a0cfc87fc18f4b4a53ffcd4b0898","db_id":905,"person_id":1731}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Skirmantas","last_name":"Alisauskas","fullName":"Alisauskas, Skirmantas","id":"905","affiliation":"Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron DESY","emailHash":"a1c6a0cfc87fc18f4b4a53ffcd4b0898","db_id":905,"person_id":1731},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Anne-Lise","last_name":"Viotti","fullName":"Viotti, Anne-Lise","id":"899","affiliation":"Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron DESY","emailHash":"552808173839622d8f13fd625bf27619","db_id":899,"person_id":1730},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Bastian","last_name":"Manschwetus","fullName":"Manschwetus, Bastian","id":"901","affiliation":"Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron DESY","emailHash":"edca5673e7d7d41da9e9041a459a22a8","db_id":901,"person_id":1728},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Huseyin","last_name":"Cankaya","fullName":"Cankaya, Huseyin","id":"903","affiliation":"Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron DESY","emailHash":"204a1fe63a602dae1f40d9a586a64e8f","db_id":903,"person_id":1726},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Marcus","last_name":"Seidel","fullName":"Seidel, Marcus","id":"902","affiliation":"Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron DESY","emailHash":"f27afcfd52ab97714735e4e809fc3d48","db_id":902,"person_id":1732},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Ayhan","last_name":"Tajalli","fullName":"Tajalli, Ayhan","id":"900","affiliation":"Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron DESY","emailHash":"def0764635f5a831120a79f06f52b397","db_id":900,"person_id":1729},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Ingmar","last_name":"Hartl","fullName":"Hartl, Ingmar","id":"904","affiliation":"Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron DESY","emailHash":"82f7159c2997f2409b743ae1e1882400","db_id":904,"person_id":1727}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":"User experiments","session":"User experiments","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"FRAO4","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"87","db_id":352,"friendly_id":87,"title":"Novel Lattice Instability in Ultrafast Photoexcited SnSe","startDate":{"date":"2022-08-26","time":"09:15:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2022-08-26","time":"09:45:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":30,"roomFullname":"Auditorium Generali","room":"Auditorium Generali","note":{},"location":"Trieste Convention Centre","type":"Invited Orals","description":"There has been growing interest in using ultrafast light pulses to drive materials into nonequilibrium states with novel properties. Using time-resolved X ray scattering, I demonstrated that SnSe, one of the IV-VI resonantly bonded compounds, hosts a novel photo-induced lattice instability associated with an orthorhombic distortion of the rock-salt structure with space group Immm [1]. The new lattice instability is accompanied by a drastic softening of the lowest-frequency Ag phonon (TO phonon), which has previously been identified as the soft mode in the thermally driven phase transition to a Cmcm structure. Therefore, we provide a counterexample of the conventional wisdom that laser pump pulse serves as a heat dump. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the photoinduced Immm lattice instability arises from electron excitation from the Se 4p- and Sn 5s-derived bands (the lone pair orbitals) deep below the Fermi level that cannot be excited thermally. \r\nFurthermore, I show results of non-zone-center measurements of time-resolved X-ray scattering, from which I extracted interatomic force constants in the photoexcited states. and identify a certain bond that is largely overlapped with the lone pair orbital as responsible for the observed photoinduced lattice instability. The conclusion is in contrary to the consensus that in thermal equilibrium, the resonant bonding network of chalcogen p orbitals is the main origin for lattice instability and a soft TO mode. And indeed, the photoexcited phonon modes have a significantly longer lifetime, which means less anharmonicity of the lattice, than those in thermal equilibrium, consistent with the observation that interatomic interaction driving the photoinduced lattice instability is different from the thermal.\r\nThe results have implications for optical control of the functional properties of monochalcogenides and other resonantly bonded materials. More generally, the results emphasize the importance ultrafast structural probes that reveal distinct atomic-scale dynamics too subtle for conventional spectroscopies.\r\nThis work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences through the Division of Materials Sciences and Engineering under Contract No. DE-AC02- 76SF00515.  \r\n[1] Y.

built as a seeded source, for precise control of the properties of its light pulses. Its excellent longitudinal coherence is inherited from the seed laser, and is its uppermost distinctive feature. In the realm of atomic, molecular and optical science, the use of longitudinal coherence of laboratory lasers as a time reference for precise measurements, as a control parameter for the synthesis of arbitrary waveforms, and for steering the outcome of a photophysical process, has a long history of achievements. One wishes to extend the same concepts to shorter wavelengths, because the latter provide higher spatial and temporal resolution, as well as chemical selectivity. In this talk I will present the challenges faced and the solutions found towards this goal, as well as the applications demonstrated so far, such as: coherent control of photoionization, measurement of photoemission delays, sensitive detection of weak processes, or the generation of periodic waveforms.\r\n\r\nThe results originate from the joint effort of many international laboratories and of a large number of researchers, whose work is gratefully acknowledged.","folders":[{"_type":"folder","id":226,"title":null,"description":"","attachments":[],"default_folder":true,"is_protected":false}],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/354\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Carlo","last_name":"Callegari","fullName":"Callegari, Carlo","id":"665","affiliation":"Elettra-Sincrotrone Trieste S.C.p.A.","emailHash":"343c1b2b5d26cd019501f9b6ed75227a","db_id":665,"person_id":1499}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Carlo","last_name":"Callegari","fullName":"Callegari, Carlo","id":"665","affiliation":"Elettra-Sincrotrone Trieste S.C.p.A.","emailHash":"343c1b2b5d26cd019501f9b6ed75227a","db_id":665,"person_id":1499}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":"End-to-end experiments (machine driven)","session":"End-to-end experiments (machine driven)","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"FRBI1","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"217","db_id":353,"friendly_id":217,"title":"Observation of Coherent Electronic Motion with X-Ray Free-Electron Lasers","startDate":{"date":"2022-08-26","time":"11:30:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2022-08-26","time":"12:00:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":30,"roomFullname":"Auditorium Generali","room":"Auditorium Generali","note":{},"location":"Trieste Convention Centre","type":"Invited Orals","description":"Electron motion is a key ingredient of every chemical processes. The natural timescale for such electronic dynamics in small molecular systems is typically in the range of tens to hundreds of attoseconds. Here I will present recent experimental results using attosecond x-ray free electron laser pulses and pulse pairs to probe ultrafast electronic motion. X-ray free-electron lasers offer continuous wavelength tunability across the soft x-ray region allowing for atomic-site specific probes of the electron density in molecular systems. \r\n\r\nI will present our first results showing isolated attosecond soft X-ray pulses from the FEL, with peak power approaching the terawatt scale. Such high power pulses open the door for nonlinear spectroscopies such as pump\/probe spectroscopy, and X-ray wave mixing. We have demonstrated the preparation of a coherent electronic wavepacket by driving stimulated X-ray Raman scattering. Combing attosecond X-ray pulses with an external laser field we are able to time-resolve the photoemission dynamics of core-level electrons in molecules, observing the coherent evolution of a wavepacket of core-excited states.  I will also show the first results from a x-ray pump\/x-ray probe measurement of ionization induced charge motion. \r\n\r\nUse of the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS), SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, is supported by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences (BES) under Contract No. DE-AC02-76SF00515.

However, the user community still lacks access to phase-locked X-ray pulses, desirable for time domain correlation spectroscopies and coherent quantum control. Based on selective electron-bunch degradation in the accelerator, combined with two-stage, self-seeded photon emission, we propose an FEL mode generating subfemtosecond, phase-locked X-ray pulse pairs with up to 100 fs delay. Splitting the electron bunch in the accelerator, instead of photon pulses in the beamline, avoids relative phase jitter. This enables time-domain interferometry, such as the X-ray analog of the ubiquitous Fourier transform infrared spectrometer, and, more generally, all of nonlinear and quantum optics requiring coherent copies of beams.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/377\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Sven","last_name":"Reiche","fullName":"Reiche, Sven","id":"925","affiliation":"Paul Scherrer Institut","emailHash":"4bbd5078fd07b129c2524e6aba1cc659","db_id":925,"person_id":1539},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Bill","last_name":"Pedrini","fullName":"Pedrini, Bill","id":"927","affiliation":"Paul Scherrer Institute","emailHash":"19b91a0e1349aca579fb3c83df80cfe4","db_id":927,"person_id":1541},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Eduard","last_name":"Prat","fullName":"Prat, Eduard","id":"924","affiliation":"Paul Scherrer Institut","emailHash":null,"db_id":924,"person_id":1482},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Gabriel","last_name":"Aeppli","fullName":"Aeppli, Gabriel","id":"926","affiliation":"Paul Scherrer Institut and ETH Zurich","emailHash":null,"db_id":926,"person_id":1476},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Simon","last_name":"Gerber","fullName":"Gerber, Simon","id":"928","affiliation":"Paul Scherrer Institute","emailHash":"3a2920d9db0dc2a6c9f621a9cda00bf4","db_id":928,"person_id":1540}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Sven","last_name":"Reiche","fullName":"Reiche, Sven","id":"925","affiliation":"Paul Scherrer Institut","emailHash":"4bbd5078fd07b129c2524e6aba1cc659","db_id":925,"person_id":1539},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Bill","last_name":"Pedrini","fullName":"Pedrini, Bill","id":"927","affiliation":"Paul Scherrer Institute","emailHash":"19b91a0e1349aca579fb3c83df80cfe4","db_id":927,"person_id":1541},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Eduard","last_name":"Prat","fullName":"Prat, Eduard","id":"924","affiliation":"Paul Scherrer Institut","emailHash":null,"db_id":924,"person_id":1482},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Gabriel","last_name":"Aeppli","fullName":"Aeppli, Gabriel","id":"926","affiliation":"Paul Scherrer Institut and ETH Zurich","emailHash":null,"db_id":926,"person_id":1476},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Simon","last_name":"Gerber","fullName":"Gerber, Simon","id":"928","affiliation":"Paul Scherrer Institute","emailHash":"3a2920d9db0dc2a6c9f621a9cda00bf4","db_id":928,"person_id":1540}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":"End-to-end experiments (machine driven)","session":"End-to-end experiments (machine driven)","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"FRBO4","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"70","db_id":376,"friendly_id":70,"title":"The Role of Light Possessing Orbital Angular Momentum in Ptychographic Imaging Experiments","startDate":{"date":"2022-08-26","time":"12:00:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2022-08-26","time":"12:25:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":25,"roomFullname":"Auditorium Generali","room":"Auditorium Generali","note":{},"location":"Trieste Convention Centre","type":"Contributed Oral","description":"The use of light beams possessing orbital angular momentum (OAM) is rapidly becoming a way for probing condensed-matter systems, even in the XUV range [1]. The wavefronts of such beams are characterized by an azimuthal angular dependence of the electric field phase, associated with an OAM topological charge $\\ell \\neq 0$. For imaging purposes, it has been shown that OAM beams can overcome the Rayleigh criterion limit, so enhancing the theoretical resolution with respect to gaussian illumination ($\\ell = 0$) [2]. We tested this feature at the DiProI beamline of the FERMI FEL by performing ptychographic experiments with a standard sample [3,4]. As predicted, the ptychographic reconstructions with OAM beams showed a higher image resolution, and the retrieved illumination functions proved to be very sensitive to optical aberrations. This study will potentially provide the basis for new characterization and diagnostic tools, since the extra degree of freedom $\\ell$ can be exploited for tuning the light-matter interaction even during pump-probe experiments.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/376\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Matteo","last_name":"Pancaldi","fullName":"Pancaldi,

superradiant FEL is present. The smart line is controlled by Artificial Intelligence (AI) intended for a wide tunable broad-spectrum THz radiation propagation. The main goal is to transfer radiation in the most efficient way. A 3D analysis and diagnostic of radiation space-frequency tool was developed. The AI changes the functions of the mirrors in such a way that all the reflected rays will reach the target. The rays represent the electromagnetic field similar to a light field. The representation of the field in terms of rays was carried out using the Wigner Distribution Function. It allows describing the dynamics of field evolution in future propagation. This in turn helps with the initial design of the transmission line and facilitates the use of a Ray Tracing method for future processing. Thus, working in the linear and non-linear regimes. The Ray Tracing method and code is greatly enhanced using parallel processing with graphics cards.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/452\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Michael","last_name":"Gerasimov","fullName":"Gerasimov, Michael","id":"1437","affiliation":"Ariel University","emailHash":"660afba2dc50cecdfb0c81b119361de7","db_id":1437,"person_id":2163}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Michael","last_name":"Gerasimov","fullName":"Gerasimov, Michael","id":"1437","affiliation":"Ariel University","emailHash":"660afba2dc50cecdfb0c81b119361de7","db_id":1437,"person_id":2163},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Egor","last_name":"Dyunin","fullName":"Dyunin, Egor","id":"1439","affiliation":"Ariel University","emailHash":"6664ce10807cfa3a4a4e00c0d87a460c","db_id":1439,"person_id":2164},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Jacob","last_name":"Gerasimov","fullName":"Gerasimov, Jacob","id":"1438","affiliation":"Ariel University","emailHash":"e2c73fa8e522439a6751c7b058d061ec","db_id":1438,"person_id":2165},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Aharon","last_name":"Friedman","fullName":"Friedman, Aharon","id":"2465","affiliation":"Ariel University","emailHash":"760784d32c6a663b0cd3801b865d0291","db_id":2465,"person_id":2245}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":"Novel acceleration and FEL concepts","session":"Tuesday posters","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"TUP16","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"194","db_id":606,"friendly_id":194,"title":"Real-Time Programmable Shaping for Electron and X-Ray Sources","startDate":{"date":"2022-08-23","time":"16:00:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2022-08-23","time":"18:00:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":120,"roomFullname":"Exhibition Hall","room":"Exhibition Hall","note":{},"location":"Trieste Convention Centre","type":"Contributed Poster","description":"The next generation of augmented brightness XFELs, such as LCLS-II, promises to address current challenges associated with systems with low X-ray cross-sections. Typical photoinjector lasers produce coherent ultraviolet (UV) pulses via nonlinear conversion of an infrared (IR) laser. Fast and active beam manipulation is required to capitalize on this new generation of XFELs, and controlling the phase space of the electron beam is achieved by shaping the UV source. However current techniques for such shaping in the UV rely on stacking pulses in time, which leads to unavoidable intensity modulations and hence space-charge driven microbunching instabilities [1]. Traditional methods for upconversion do not preserve phase shape and thus require more complicated means of arriving at the desired pulse shapes after nonlinear upconversion [2]. Upconversion through four-waving mixing (FWM) allows direct phase transfer, convenient wavelength tunability by easily changeable phase matching parameters, and also has the added advantage of greater average power handling than traditional \u03c7(2) nonlinear processes [3, 4,]. Therefore, we examine a possible solution for e-beam shaping using a machine learning (ML) implementation of real-time photoinjector laser manipulation which shapes the IR laser source and then uses FWM for the nonlinear upconversion and shaping simultaneously. Our presentation will focus on the software model of the photoinjector laser, the associated ML models, and the optical setup. We anticipate this approach to not only enable active experimental control of X-ray pulse characteristics but could also increase the operational capacity of future e-beam sources, accelerator facilities, and XFELs.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n[1] S.

We'll also discuss the longer term plans for the setup where by embedding the undulator in an optical cavity matched with the high repetition rate from the superconducting accelerator (3,9 MHz), a very high average power laser source can be obtained. Eventually, the laser pulses can be redirected onto the relativistic electrons to generate by inverse compton scattering a very high flux of circularly polarized gamma rays for polarized positron production.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/549\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Pietro","last_name":"Musumeci","fullName":"Musumeci,

duty factor was developed to provide a high-quality electron source for superconducting linac driven free-electron lasers like FLASH and European XFEL. Compared to the Gun4 series, Gun5 aims for a ~50% longer RF pulse length (RF pulse duration of up to 1 ms at 10 Hz repetition rate) combined with high gradients (up to ~60 MV\/m at the cathode). In addition to the improved cell geometry and cooling concept, the new cavity is equipped with an RF probe to measure and control the amplitude and phase of the RF field inside the gun. The first characterization of Gun5.1 included measurements of RF amplitude and phase stability (pulse-to-pulse and along 1 ms RF pulse). The dark current was measured at various peak power levels. The results of this characterization will be reported.","folders":[{"_type":"folder","id":202,"title":null,"description":"","attachments":[],"default_folder":true,"is_protected":false}],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/515\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Mikhail","last_name":"Krasilnikov","fullName":"Krasilnikov,

A main goal of the project is to generate fully coherent soft X-ray FEL radiation at a high repetition rate (MHz). The project will utilize two external laser seeding principles in order to produced Seeded FEL with tunable wavelength from 4-60 nm. In order to achieve this goal, both HGHG (High Gain Harmonic Generation) and EEHG (Echo-Enhanced Harmonic Generation) methods provide FEL emission at harmonics of a seed laser. For HGHG, a tunable UV laser system (297-317 nm) and for EEHG a combination of the tunable UV laser and fixed wavelength (343 nm) laser system would be used to cover the whole range of wavelengths between 4-60 nm.\r\nIn this contribution, we will describe the requirements of the seed laser to initiate the seeding process and will explain the concept of seed laser beam transport and incoupling into the modulators for FEL radiation production.\r\nThe first seed laser (Seed1) with fixed wavelength is transported about 28 meters from laser lab to the incoupling chicane. The second seed laser (Seed2) with a tunable UV wavelength is transported about 35 meters.\r\nOur concept uses a full relay imaging system and in vacuum components for the laser transport in addition to high repetition rate diagnostics to deliver, monitor and control the beam and pulse parameters at the interaction with electron beam. We investigate the technical and engineering limitations for the design and address those challenges to provide the demanding seed laser parameters for generating high repetition rate seeded FEL.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/457\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Mehdi","last_name":"M.

However, it is observed that the number of output optical pulse cycles is much less than the number of undulator periods and therefore the radiation spectral bandwidth has been broadened. It is found that the dispersion of undulator with excessive energy spread is responsible for this undesired broadening of THz radiation spectrum. In this study, instead of using rectilinear rf bunch compression (i.e. velocity bunching) in photoinjector linac, we investigate the feasibility of using nonlinear magnetic bunch compression for spectral bandwidth control of coherent THz undulator

spectral regions are presently available for attosecond pump-probe spectroscopy and extreme ultraviolet lithography for chip manufacturing, ultrafast atomic-scale microscopy, and nonlinear X-ray optics. There are two main approaches to produce attosecond light pulses: high-harmonic generation (HHG) in gas-phase or solid-state matter based on the three-step model, and X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) based on self-amplified spontaneous emission (SASE) and laser seeding processes of relativistic free electrons traveling through an undulator. Here, we propose a novel route of producing attosecond laser pulses, based on the generation of attosecond electron pulse trains in photon-induced near-field electron microscopy (PINEM), combined with the SASE principle for light amplification. Our scheme relies on high-density nanotip arrays emitting dense electron bunches that are subsequently modulated with a PINEM-type interaction, enabling high-gain for amplification of XUV\/SXR high harmonic radiation. Our PINEM-HHG mechanism using attosecond electron pulses can serve as promising ultra-bright extreme ultraviolet\/soft X-ray attosecond laser sources.","folders":[{"_type":"folder","id":217,"title":null,"description":"","attachments":[{"_type":"attachment","id":727,"download_url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/529\/attachments\/217\/727\/FEL2022-poster-HHG-PINEM.pdf","title":"FEL2022-poster-HHG-PINEM.pdf","description":"","modified_dt":"2022-08-20T06:16:44.285364+00:00","type":"file","is_protected":false,"filename":"FEL2022-poster-HHG-PINEM.pdf","content_type":"application\/pdf","size":651403,"checksum":"d0c8414e8e3b68f4449ea277a8289153"}],"default_folder":true,"is_protected":false}],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/529\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Ido","last_name":"Kaminer","fullName":"Kaminer, Ido","id":"1993","affiliation":"Israel Institute of Technology","emailHash":null,"db_id":1993,"person_id":2125},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Michael","last_name":"Krueger","fullName":"Krueger, Michael","id":"1992","affiliation":"Israel Institute of Technology","emailHash":null,"db_id":1992,"person_id":2124},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Yiming","last_name":"Pan","fullName":"Pan, Yiming","id":"1994","affiliation":"Israel Institute of Technology","emailHash":"e6ff03cb883e3067b0d4f83688080192","db_id":1994,"person_id":2126}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Yiming","last_name":"Pan","fullName":"Pan, Yiming","id":"1994","affiliation":"Israel Institute of Technology","emailHash":"e6ff03cb883e3067b0d4f83688080192","db_id":1994,"person_id":2126}],"coauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Ido","last_name":"Kaminer","fullName":"Kaminer, Ido","id":"1993","affiliation":"Israel Institute of Technology","emailHash":null,"db_id":1993,"person_id":2125},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Michael","last_name":"Krueger","fullName":"Krueger, Michael","id":"1992","affiliation":"Israel Institute of Technology","emailHash":null,"db_id":1992,"person_id":2124}],"keywords":[],"track":"Novel acceleration and FEL concepts","session":"Tuesday posters","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"TUP24","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"183","db_id":483,"friendly_id":183,"title":"Calculation of the CSR Effect on EEHG Performance","startDate":{"date":"2022-08-23","time":"17:40:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2022-08-23","time":"18:00:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Exhibition Hall","room":"Exhibition Hall","note":{},"location":"Trieste Convention Centre","type":"Contributed Poster","description":"Externally seeded FELs can produce fully coherent short-wavelength pulses with the advantage of higher shot-to-shot stability and spectral intensity than SASE radiation. For the FLASH2020+ project, the Echo-Enabled Harmonic Generation (EEHG) seeding technique achieves seeded FEL radiation in the XUV and soft X-ray range down to wavelengths of 4 nm. The implementation of the EEHG requires precise phase space manipulations in the seeding section of the beamline, which would make the performance of the EEHG sensitive to the collective effects, such as Coherent Synchrotron Radiation (CSR) in some working range. Therefore, it is essential to consider the CSR in EEHG simulations and to understand its impact on the electron beam properties. In this work, we compare different methods for calculating CSR and investigate the mechanism of its effect on the EEHG performance.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/483\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Dmitrii","last_name":"Samoilenko","fullName":"Samoilenko, Dmitrii","id":"1598","affiliation":"University of Hamburg","emailHash":"e915dd36afcb693620d36138ec066bc2","db_id":1598,"person_id":1771}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Dmitrii","last_name":"Samoilenko","fullName":"Samoilenko, Dmitrii","id":"1598","affiliation":"University of Hamburg","emailHash":"e915dd36afcb693620d36138ec066bc2","db_id":1598,"person_id":1771},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Lucas","last_name":"Schaper","fullName":"Schaper, Lucas","id":"1595","affiliation":"Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron","emailHash":"e80e5283507b8228b752a43ee34fd627","db_id":1595,"person_id":1287},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Najmeh","last_name":"Mirian","fullName":"Mirian, Najmeh","id":"1597","affiliation":"Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron","emailHash":"07bf04b3dd56022001fc710e08e6be97","db_id":1597,"person_id":1139},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Pardis","last_name":"Niknejadi","fullName":"Niknejadi, Pardis","id":"1600","affiliation":"Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron","emailHash":"b95681d326d05b0a447ff2bf07723fdd","db_id":1600,"person_id":1776},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Wolfgang","last_name":"Hillert","fullName":"Hillert, Wolfgang","id":"1596","affiliation":"University of Hamburg","emailHash":"ed6f72ec740e0d0a1cf97f8976aac47c","db_id":1596,"person_id":1706},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Demin","last_name":"Zhou","fullName":"Zhou, Demin","id":"1599","affiliation":"High Energy Accelerator Research Organization (KEK), Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan","emailHash":"a2727ddd3f271c3727824fd3b37e884a","db_id":1599,"person_id":1965}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":"Seeded FEL","session":"Tuesday posters","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"TUP74","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"174","db_id":505,"friendly_id":174,"title":"Stable Multi-Day Performance of a Laser Wakefield Accelerator for FEL Applications","startDate":{"date":"2022-08-23","time":"17:40:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2022-08-23","time":"18:00:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Exhibition Hall","room":"Exhibition Hall","note":{},"location":"Trieste Convention Centre","type":"Contributed Poster","description":"We report on the operation of the DRACO Laser Driven electron source for stable multi-day operation for FEL applications.

(Hamburg, Germany) is currently undergoing a major upgrade to become the first high repetition rate, fully coherent FEL light source worldwide [1]. To reach this goal, one of the two in parallel operated FEL branches will be seeded at a fixed wavelength at 343 nm in a first step (SEED 1) and tunable between 297 nm to 317 nm in a second step (SEED 2) following the two-color Echo-Enhanced Harmonic Generation (EEHG) scheme [2]. The seed laser system is designed to deliver UV pulse energies > 50 \u00b5J and > 100 \u00b5J for SEED 1 and SEED 2, respectively, and with 6000 pulses in one second (1 MHz pulse trains in 600 \u00b5s - 10 Hz bursts). In combination with the EEHG seeding principle, this will allow for the generation of high harmonics corresponding to XUV FEL pulses with photon energies of more than 300 eV (down to 4 nm in wavelength). In order to exploit the full capabilities of the narrow-band fully coherent FEL pulses for 24\/7 scientific user experiments, the seed laser needs to provide broadly tunable, high power UV laser pulses with pulse durations of 50 fs, excellent beam quality and exceptional high short and long-term stability in respect to the seeding wavelength (< 2e-4), pulse \u2013 pulse energy (< 2%) and pointing jitter (< 20 \u00b5rad). Altogether, the requirements on the laser system are beyond state-of-the-art.\r\n   We will present the concept as well as the first experimental results of our novel high-power seed laser system based on a 5 kW Inno-Slab CPA pump laser system, optical parametric chirped pulse amplification (OPCPA) and a highly efficient UV conversion scheme. An extensive numerical study based on a 3+1 dimensional start-to-end simulation code (chi3D) allows for a precise predictions of system performance in terms of output power, tunability, beam quality and stability in respect to the measured input parameters and respective statistical and systematic fluctuations. The theoretical results are confirmed by first experimental studies being in excellent agreement in terms of UV conversion efficiency, beam quality and the predicated improvement of the pulse-to-pulse stability compared to the OPCPA stability. The insides of this study had major impact on the conceptual design of the laser system, especially the dispersion concept and the best implementation of user controls, such as power attenuation and fast wavelength control, etc.\r\n[1] M.

similar as UV sensitive (Cs2Te) photocathodes, but with the advantages of photoemission sensitivity in the visible region of the light spectrum and a significant reduction in the mean transverse energy of photoelectrons. A batch of three KCs2Sb photocathodes was grown on molybdenum substrates via a sequential deposition method in a new preparation system at INFN LASA. Afterwards, the cathodes were successfully tested in the high gradient RF gun at PITZ. This contribution summarizes the experimental results obtained in both the preparation chamber and the RF gun. Based on those findings, we are now optimizing the recipe of KCs2Sb and NaKSb(Cs) photocathodes for lower field emission and longer lifetime, and the measurements for the latest photocathodes with the improved recipe are also presented.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/471\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Sandeep","last_name":"Mohanty","fullName":"Mohanty, Sandeep","id":"1539","affiliation":"Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron DESY at Zeuthen","emailHash":"9b3bff5d0ea06dc80492de60cf28de56","db_id":1539,"person_id":1733}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Sandeep","last_name":"Mohanty","fullName":"Mohanty, Sandeep","id":"1539","affiliation":"Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron DESY at Zeuthen","emailHash":"9b3bff5d0ea06dc80492de60cf28de56","db_id":1539,"person_id":1733}],"coauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Andreas","last_name":"Hoffmann","fullName":"Hoffmann, Andreas","id":"2557","affiliation":"Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron DESY at Zeuthen","emailHash":null,"db_id":2557,"person_id":1310},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Anne","last_name":"Oppelt","fullName":"Oppelt, Anne","id":"1543","affiliation":"Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron DESY at Zeuthen","emailHash":null,"db_id":1543,"person_id":1302},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Anusorn","last_name":"Lueangaramwong","fullName":"Lueangaramwong, Anusorn","id":"2558","affiliation":"Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron DESY at Zeuthen","emailHash":null,"db_id":2558,"person_id":1297},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"C.","last_name":"Pagani","fullName":"Pagani, C.","id":"1537","affiliation":"Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Milano & INFN, Segrate, Italy","emailHash":null,"db_id":1537,"person_id":1963},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Daniele","last_name":"Sertore","fullName":"Sertore, Daniele","id":"1546","affiliation":"INFN-LASA","emailHash":"385cd425f43761b0b07687cc544e230f","db_id":1546,"person_id":1281},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Frank","last_name":"Stephan","fullName":"Stephan, Frank","id":"1541","affiliation":"Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron DESY at Zeuthen","emailHash":"ffe13adf3c2385c4b4c6eab1d3a8b4bf","db_id":1541,"person_id":1307},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"G.

We have achieved outstanding performance of HXRSS FEL over photon energy range covering from 3.5 keV to 14.6 keV at PAL-XFEL. Furthermore, an averaged energy of seed FEL of ~1mJ is obtained in the range from 5 keV to 10 keV. With these pulses single-shot coherent imaging (SSI) experiment and serial femtosecond crystallography (SFX) were performed. We developed x-ray energy scanning program with the help of double crystal monochromator (DCM), which results in improved spectral impurity and fully calibrated energy scale. With this energy scanning program, we have conducted test experiments such as resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) and X-ray emission spectroscopy (XES), femtosecond time resolved X-ray absorption near edge structure (TR-XANES).

In this contribution, the concept of an R&D project for installation of an XFELO demonstrator experiment at the European XFEL facility is conceptually presented. It is composed of an X-ray cavity design in backscattering geometry of 133\u00a0m round trip length with four undulator sections of 20\u00a0m total length producing the FEL radiation. It uses cryocooled diamond crystals and employs the concept of retroreflection to reduce the sensitivity to vibrations. Start to end simulations were carried out which account for realistic electron bunch distributions, inter RF-pulse bunch fluctuations, various possible errors of the X-ray optics as well as the impact of heat load on the diamond crystals. The estimated performance and stability derived from these simulations shall be reported and foreseen issues shall be discussed.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/431\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Patrick","last_name":"Rauer","fullName":"Rauer,

The FEL is envisioned to operate in the wavelength range from 50 to 250 nm with pulse energies of about 30 \u00b5J throughout the wavelength range, and a pulse length of a few 100 fs. The SRF LINAC technology developed and used at the Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf for the Radiation Source ELBE is planned to be used for the driver-accelerator. This allows operating an electron beam with an average current of 1 mA on the order of magnitude, pulse repetition rate of up to 10 MHz, and the bunch charge of 100 pC, as used for the FEL design. We consider using the HGHG to allow the generation of fully coherent pulses. The high repetition rate electron beam makes it possible to construct an FEL oscillator that would be used as the high repetition rate seed of the HGHG amplifier. In the proposed scheme, the SRF LINAC provides beams for the seeding oscillator and the HGHG amplifier simultaneously. The described FEL would create new experimental regimes, not available at any other photon source. These could result in transformative changes in physical chemistry studies in the gas phase and at the interfaces, e.g., heterogeneous catalysis.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/600\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Pavel","last_name":"Evtushenko","fullName":"Evtushenko, Pavel","id":"2438","affiliation":"Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf","emailHash":"411daa274871277f09d19aff2d806f5a","db_id":2438,"person_id":2217}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Pavel","last_name":"Evtushenko","fullName":"Evtushenko, Pavel","id":"2438","affiliation":"Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf","emailHash":"411daa274871277f09d19aff2d806f5a","db_id":2438,"person_id":2217}],"coauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Alec","last_name":"Wodtke","fullName":"Wodtke, Alec","id":"2437","affiliation":"Max Planck Institute for Multidisciplinary Sciences","emailHash":"37cc3eed8614ac2575e18e32cc92c442","db_id":2437,"person_id":2218}],"keywords":[],"track":"Seeded FEL","session":"Tuesday posters","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"TUP77","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"236","db_id":577,"friendly_id":236,"title":"Quantum to Classical Transition of Free Electron Interaction with Light","startDate":{"date":"2022-08-23","time":"17:40:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2022-08-23","time":"18:00:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Exhibition Hall","room":"Exhibition Hall","note":{},"location":"Trieste Convention Centre","type":"Contributed Poster","description":"We present a theory for free electrons interaction with radiation in both classical and quantum regimes and delineate their transition, based on a model of quantum electron wavepacket (QEW). The theory has general validity for a wide range of free electron interaction and radiation sources, including Free Electron Lasers, Cerenkov radiation, and transition radiation. We exemplify our analysis with the schemes of Smith-Purcell radiation and dielectric laser acceleration (DLA). These interactions, which were studied in terms of point particle physics, have a quantum nature in a phenomenon known as \u201cphoton-induced near-field electron microscopy\u201d (PINEM). \r\nOur QEW model identifies three universal distinct interaction regimes: (i) near-point-particle acceleration\/deceleration DLA regime, (ii) PINEM regime of multiphoton induced electron energy sidebands, and (iii) anomalous PINEM regime (APINEM) of a newly reported periodic spectral bunching. See the three regimes in Fig.2.\r\nThe formulation displays the transition of the FEL stimulated gain expression from the quantum to classical limit. Elsewhere we provided extension of the semiclassical model to quantum electrodynamics to include spontaneous emission and spontaneous superradiance by modulated QEW similar to the classical prebunched-beam superradiant FEL in the classical point-particle picture\u3002","folders":[{"_type":"folder","id":218,"title":null,"description":"","attachments":[{"_type":"attachment","id":730,"download_url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/577\/attachments\/218\/730\/Bin-QEW%20light%20interaction-last.pdf","title":"Bin-QEW light interaction-last.pdf","description":"","modified_dt":"2022-08-20T06:30:48.621504+00:00","type":"file","is_protected":false,"filename":"Bin-QEW light interaction-last.pdf","content_type":"application\/pdf","size":737107,"checksum":"d8d299376a103387a04ad69873bac0de"}],"default_folder":true,"is_protected":false}],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/577\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Bin","last_name":"Zhang","fullName":"Zhang, Bin","id":"2353","affiliation":"University of Tel-Aviv","emailHash":"b37b9bd3863ae83f84c631ce8b34db4e","db_id":2353,"person_id":2131}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Bin","last_name":"Zhang","fullName":"Zhang, Bin","id":"2353","affiliation":"University of Tel-Aviv","emailHash":"b37b9bd3863ae83f84c631ce8b34db4e","db_id":2353,"person_id":2131}],"coauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Yiming","last_name":"Pan","fullName":"Pan, Yiming","id":"2357","affiliation":"Israel Institute of Technology","emailHash":"e6ff03cb883e3067b0d4f83688080192","db_id":2357,"person_id":2126},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Ran","last_name":"Du","fullName":"Du, Ran","id":"2352","affiliation":"Tel Aviv University","emailHash":null,"db_id":2352,"person_id":2127},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Reruven","last_name":"Ianconescu","fullName":"Ianconescu, Reruven","id":"2355","affiliation":"Shenkar College of Engineering and Design","emailHash":null,"db_id":2355,"person_id":2128},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Jacob","last_name":"Scheuer","fullName":"Scheuer, Jacob","id":"2354","affiliation":"","emailHash":null,"db_id":2354,"person_id":2129},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Avraham","last_name":"Gover","fullName":"Gover, Avraham","id":"2356","affiliation":"University of Tel-Aviv","emailHash":"2a43f977a54d26e9787e575fda6761e1","db_id":2356,"person_id":2132},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Aharon","last_name":"Friedman","fullName":"Friedman, Aharon","id":"2466","affiliation":"Ariel University","emailHash":"760784d32c6a663b0cd3801b865d0291","db_id":2466,"person_id":2245}],"keywords":[],"track":"Novel acceleration and FEL concepts","session":"Tuesday posters","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"TUP36","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"51","db_id":499,"friendly_id":51,"title":"Photocathodes for the Electron Sources at FLASH and European XFEL","startDate":{"date":"2022-08-23","time":"17:40:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2022-08-23","time":"18:00:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Exhibition Hall","room":"Exhibition Hall","note":{},"location":"Trieste Convention Centre","type":"Contributed Poster","description":"The photoinjectors of FLASH at DESY (Hamburg, Germany) and the European XFEL are operated by laser driven RF-guns.

We show for the first time a scheme to provide transversally separated pulses with parallel or crossed linear polarizations, realized at FERMI FEL. This configuration paves the way to explore additional features of pump&probe and FWM techniques, and, in particular, the possibility to excite a transient polarization grating on the sample. For this reason, such a technique is important the detection of circular dichroism and chiral properties of matter and the characterization of spin waves and magnons. By tailoring the electrons trajectory along the undulator line, we demonstrate the possibility of deliver balanced and stable couple of pulses with an horizontal separation of the order of millimeters

operated in the HGHG configuration is determined by the wavelength of the seed laser and light is emitted when undulators are tuned to one of the harmonics of the seed laser. In a more realistic case, when taking into account the electron beam imperfections and the finite bandwidths of the seed and of the amplification process, the output wavelength is influenced by these factors and there is a small variation from this rule.\r\nIn this work, we consider the effects of the dispersive section, the curvature of the electron beam longitudinal phase-space and the frequency pulling as major contributors. We show how these quantities influence the effective final FEL wavelength. Furthermore, we show how one can reconstruct the electron beam longitudinal phase-space from the analysis of the FEL wavelength sensitivity to the seed laser delay with respect to the beam arrival time.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/416\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Filippo","last_name":"Sottocorona","fullName":"Sottocorona, Filippo","id":"1210","affiliation":"Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Trieste","emailHash":"29328aa2c903014f717a023fcc299143","db_id":1210,"person_id":1134},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Giovanni","last_name":"Perosa","fullName":"Perosa, Giovanni","id":"2809","affiliation":"Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Trieste","emailHash":"1b41fb321d2d606478e675b89e7e8e6f","db_id":2809,"person_id":1127}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Filippo","last_name":"Sottocorona","fullName":"Sottocorona, Filippo","id":"1210","affiliation":"Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Trieste","emailHash":"29328aa2c903014f717a023fcc299143","db_id":1210,"person_id":1134},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Enrico","last_name":"Allaria","fullName":"Allaria, Enrico","id":"1208","affiliation":"Elettra-Sincrotrone Trieste S.C.p.A.","emailHash":"f3da95a24a366d2b8598e5ea79ae7aa8","db_id":1208,"person_id":1500},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Luca","last_name":"Giannessi","fullName":"Giannessi, Luca","id":"1213","affiliation":"Elettra Sincrotrone Trieste and Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare","emailHash":"c5350c011f76a90ef163bde22a2ea215","db_id":1213,"person_id":448},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Miltcho","last_name":"Danailov","fullName":"Danailov, Miltcho","id":"1212","affiliation":"Elettra-Sincrotrone Trieste S.C.p.A.","emailHash":"343d870cfa1fbd69c1bd8edcab82cfc2","db_id":1212,"person_id":1586},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Simone","last_name":"Di Mitri","fullName":"Di Mitri, Simone","id":"1211","affiliation":"Elettra-Sincrotrone Trieste S.C.p.A.","emailHash":"04a73bfcde6c346288ea012239f50fe1","db_id":1211,"person_id":450},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Giovanni","last_name":"Perosa","fullName":"Perosa, Giovanni","id":"2809","affiliation":"Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Trieste","emailHash":"1b41fb321d2d606478e675b89e7e8e6f","db_id":2809,"person_id":1127}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":"Seeded FEL","session":"Tuesday posters","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"TUP58","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"196","db_id":379,"friendly_id":196,"title":"Experimental Demonstration of Temporally Shaped Picosecond Optical Pulses for Driving Electron Photoinjectors","startDate":{"date":"2022-08-23","time":"16:00:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2022-08-23","time":"16:20:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Exhibition Hall","room":"Exhibition Hall","note":{},"location":"Trieste Convention Centre","type":"Contributed Poster","description":"Next-generation electron photoinjector accelerators, such as the LCLS-II photoinjector, have increasingly tight requirements on the excitation lasers, often calling for tens of picosecond, temporally flat-top, ultraviolet (UV) pulse trains to be delivered at up to 1 MHz*. We present an experimental demonstration of temporal pulse shaping for the LCLS-II photoinjector laser resulting in temporally flat-top pulses with 24 ps durations. Our technique is a non-colinear sum frequency generation scheme wherein two identical infrared optical pulses are imparted with equal and opposite amounts of spectral dispersion. The mixing of these dispersed pulses within a thick nonlinear crystal generates a second harmonic optical pulse that is spectrally narrowband with a designed temporal profile**. In experiment we achieve upwards of 40% conversion efficiency with this process allowing this to be used for high average and peak power applications. These narrowband pulses can then be directly upconverted to the UV towards use in driving free electron laser photocathodes. Additionally, we present a theoretical framework for adapting this method to shape optical pulses driving other photoinjector based applications.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/379\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Sergio","last_name":"Carbajo","fullName":"Carbajo, Sergio","id":"941","affiliation":"University of California, Los Angeles","emailHash":"051c7b969e9ae26334bf6bba94c933fa","db_id":941,"person_id":1151}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Randy","last_name":"Lemons","fullName":"Lemons, Randy","id":"943","affiliation":"SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory","emailHash":"14cfbd5098e47fb5e5bb95794deda576","db_id":943,"person_id":2010},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Nicole","last_name":"Neveu","fullName":"Neveu, Nicole","id":"938","affiliation":"SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory","emailHash":"7f8b10ec4efad1371075c4f279c69c19","db_id":938,"person_id":2013},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"Duris","fullName":"Duris, Joseph","id":"939","affiliation":"SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory","emailHash":"2663e227b9c667f1edcee3c44dad70b8","db_id":939,"person_id":2012},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Agostino","last_name":"Marinelli","fullName":"Marinelli, Agostino","id":"942","affiliation":"SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory","emailHash":"27823d2fcb0cdde7b429aeeb4c00e41b","db_id":942,"person_id":1993},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Charles","last_name":"Durfee","fullName":"Durfee, Charles","id":"940","affiliation":"Colorado School of Mines","emailHash":"6d165ac7f2a634be1308bc0bdf30430a","db_id":940,"person_id":2011},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Sergio","last_name":"Carbajo","fullName":"Carbajo, Sergio","id":"941","affiliation":"University of California, Los Angeles","emailHash":"051c7b969e9ae26334bf6bba94c933fa","db_id":941,"person_id":1151}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":"Electron sources","session":"Tuesday posters","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"TUP10","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"187","db_id":522,"friendly_id":187,"title":"Spectro-Temporal Properties of Coherently Emitted Ultrashort Radiation Pulses at DELTA","startDate":{"date":"2022-08-23","time":"17:40:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2022-08-23","time":"18:00:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Exhibition Hall","room":"Exhibition Hall","note":{},"location":"Trieste Convention Centre","type":"Contributed Poster","description":"At the 1.5 GeV synchrotron light source DELTA operated by the TU Dortmund University, the short-pulse facility employs the seeding scheme coherent harmonic generation (CHG) to produce ultrashort pulses in the vacuum ultraviolet and terahertz regime. This is achieved via a laser-induced electron energy modulation and a subsequent microbunching in a dispersive section. The spectro-temporal properties of the CHG pulses as well as the coherently emitted terahertz radiation are influenced by the seed laser parameters and can be manipulated by varying the laser pulse shape and the strength of the dispersive section. CHG spectra for different parameter sets were recorded and compared with the results of numerical simulations to reconstruct the spectra. A convolutional neural network was employed to extract the spectral phase information of the seed laser from the recorded spectra. In addition, the shaping of the coherently emitted THz pulses by controlling the seed pulse spectral phase using a spatial light modulator was also demonstrated.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/522\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Arjun","last_name":"Radha

This source delivers stable ultrafast electron bunches with a unique combination of high bunch charge and low transverse emittance ~1.9 nm\u00b7rad, demonstrating the cold electron temperature ~25 K.\r\n\r\nRecent development focused on long term stabilizing the electron beam. By pulsing the high voltage accelerator potential, the effects of surface charge buildup in the accelerator structure are mitigated and secondary electron emission as a result of ion impacts on the cathode is prevented.\r\n\r\nThis made a high resolution ponderomotive scattering measurement possible, in which a 1.1 mJ, 25 fs, 800 nm laser pulse is focused onto the electron bunch to a waist of 5.9 \u03bcm in vacuum. The ponderomotive force scatters the electrons which can be detected in the transverse profile. In this way the electron bunch length inside the self-compression point of the UCES has been measured to be 735\u00b17 fs. Some wavelength dependent temporal structure originating from the ionization process could be observed.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/561\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Tim","last_name":"de Raadt","fullName":"de Raadt, Tim","id":"2221","affiliation":"Technische Universiteit Eindhoven","emailHash":"80992ec33ef450709942f08d5bf67096","db_id":2221,"person_id":1928}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Brian","last_name":"Schaap","fullName":"Schaap, Brian","id":"2219","affiliation":"Technische Universiteit Eindhoven","emailHash":"c06198cc39b49752ca81ef1f91604c7d","db_id":2219,"person_id":1800},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Tim","last_name":"de Raadt","fullName":"de Raadt, Tim","id":"2221","affiliation":"Technische Universiteit Eindhoven","emailHash":"80992ec33ef450709942f08d5bf67096","db_id":2221,"person_id":1928},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Jom","last_name":"Luiten","fullName":"Luiten, Jom","id":"2220","affiliation":"Technische Universiteit Eindhoven","emailHash":"e693db5b25c403948951ad7287d07feb","db_id":2220,"person_id":1269}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":"Electron sources","session":"Tuesday posters","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"TUP12","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"157","db_id":417,"friendly_id":157,"title":"Recent Developments of the Laser Oscillator Synchronization for the FERMI Seed Laser","startDate":{"date":"2022-08-23","time":"17:40:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2022-08-23","time":"18:00:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Exhibition Hall","room":"Exhibition Hall","note":{},"location":"Trieste Convention Centre","type":"Contributed Poster","description":"The local laser synchronization is known to be of high importance for Free Electron facilities, affecting both machine performance and pump-probe FEL-external laser experiments.

Here we describe the latest developments and progress in this direction related to the FERMI seed laser system. The first investigated aspects includes the characterization and optimization of the locking performance of the commercial Ti:Sapphire oscillators Vitara T and HP (Coherent). We present data on the performance of three different oscillators of this type, as well as on the  effect of adding an additional cavity length control actuator. The second presented aspect is related to the plan to extend the optical synchronization layout: for some planned seed laser operation modes two Ti:Sapphire oscillator need to be synchronized simultaneously. For this purpose, studies of optimum schemes for locking the two oscillators are in progress, first results are presented.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/417\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Paolo","last_name":"Cinquegrana","fullName":"Cinquegrana, Paolo","id":"1221","affiliation":"Elettra-Sincrotrone Trieste S.C.p.A.","emailHash":"44e5edc16ac422e39c0e4990b3f4929c","db_id":1221,"person_id":1851}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Paolo","last_name":"Cinquegrana","fullName":"Cinquegrana, Paolo","id":"1221","affiliation":"Elettra-Sincrotrone Trieste S.C.p.A.","emailHash":"44e5edc16ac422e39c0e4990b3f4929c","db_id":1221,"person_id":1851},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Paolo","last_name":"Sigalotti","fullName":"Sigalotti, Paolo","id":"1220","affiliation":"Elettra-Sincrotrone Trieste S.C.p.A.","emailHash":"e6470238f1f03bb3a096d3b1847e472a","db_id":1220,"person_id":1624},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Yousef ","last_name":"El Sharkawy","fullName":"El Sharkawy, Yousef ","id":"1215","affiliation":"Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Trieste","emailHash":"ff61e1e0addc94b534b1651ba24645fd","db_id":1215,"person_id":1850},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Alexander","last_name":"Demidovich","fullName":"Demidovich, Alexander","id":"1216","affiliation":"Elettra-Sincrotrone Trieste S.C.p.A.","emailHash":"4148a135dcdf9f1625534c26fbae7da4","db_id":1216,"person_id":1613},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Ivaylo","last_name":"Nikolov","fullName":"Nikolov, Ivaylo","id":"1219","affiliation":"Elettra-Sincrotrone Trieste S.C.p.A.","emailHash":"fc99b32a172de2bd0745c071b50b8060","db_id":1219,"person_id":1619},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Gabor","last_name":"Kurdi","fullName":"Kurdi, Gabor","id":"1217","affiliation":"Elettra-Sincrotrone Trieste S.C.p.A.","emailHash":"593fcdca7830cf9367ca37e4b558bca2","db_id":1217,"person_id":1616},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Miltcho","last_name":"Danailov","fullName":"Danailov, Miltcho","id":"1222","affiliation":"Elettra-Sincrotrone Trieste S.C.p.A.","emailHash":"343d870cfa1fbd69c1bd8edcab82cfc2","db_id":1222,"person_id":1586},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Peter","last_name":"Susnjar","fullName":"Susnjar, Peter","id":"1214","affiliation":"Elettra-Sincrotrone Trieste S.C.p.A.","emailHash":"9d2375a289b2fec7e60e6fe98fdfe221","db_id":1214,"person_id":1852},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Antonio","last_name":"Conte","fullName":"Conte, Antonio","id":"1218","affiliation":"Elettra-Sincrotrone Trieste S.C.p.A.","emailHash":"1c9d5bf0777531f8f3b86700f353ba9a","db_id":1218,"person_id":1849}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":"Seeded FEL","session":"Tuesday posters","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"TUP55","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"151","db_id":398,"friendly_id":151,"title":"LAPLACIAN: A Step Forward for Compact LPA Based Electron Accelerators","startDate":{"date":"2022-08-23","time":"17:40:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2022-08-23","time":"18:00:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Exhibition Hall","room":"Exhibition Hall","note":{},"location":"Trieste Convention Centre","type":"Contributed Poster","description":"The LAPLACIAN (Laser Acceleration Platform as a Coordinated Innovation Anchor) experimental facility inside the MIRAI project framework is the Japanese answer to the global effort for the development of compact accelerators based on laser plasma acceleration (LPA) for its application to free electron laser (FEL).

and contrast. The start-to-end simulations efforts aim to take advantage of the available global pool of software and past and present extensive efforts to provide realistic simulations, particularly for cases where precise and fine manipulation of the beam phase space is concerned. Since, for such cases, tracking of beams with billions of particles through magnetic structures and handover between multiple codes are required, extensive realistic studies for such cases are limited. Here we will describe a workflow that reduces the needed computational resources and share studies of the EEHG seed section for the FLASH2020+ [1]

upgraded to deliver seeded FEL pulses for users. This upgrade will be achieved by combining high gain harmonic generation and echo-enabled harmonic generation with a wide-range wavelength-tunable seed laser, to efficiently cover the 60-4 nm wavelength range. The undulator chain will also be refurbished entirely using new radiators based on the APPLE-III design, allowing for polarization control of the generated light beams. With the superconducting linac of FLASH delivering electron beams at MHz repetition rate in burst mode, laser systems are being developed to seed at full repetition rates.

free electron laser (FEL) radiation but can be limited in repetition rates in orders of tens of Hz. This limitation is mainly posed by limited average power of the seed lasers that are required to provide hundreds of MW peak power to modulate the electron bunches. An optical-klystron-based high gain harmonic generation (HGHG) scheme, which can be implemented in several existing and upcoming seeded FEL beamlines with minimal to no additional installations, overcomes this limitation by greatly reducing the required seed laser power. In this work, we carefully study the scheme with detailed simulations that include imperfections of electron beam properties such as a quadratic electron beam energy chirp that characterizes existing FEL facilities. We discuss the optimization steps that in these conditions ensure successful operation, opening the path towards exciting science at FELs with fully coherent and high repetition rate FEL radiation.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/566\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Georgia","last_name":"Paraskaki","fullName":"Paraskaki, Georgia","id":"2291","affiliation":"Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron","emailHash":"760cd3f52c669ddf1262f21a4e8cb1ed","db_id":2291,"person_id":1749},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Lucas","last_name":"Schaper","fullName":"Schaper, Lucas","id":"2290","affiliation":"Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron","emailHash":"e80e5283507b8228b752a43ee34fd627","db_id":2290,"person_id":1287},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Evgeny","last_name":"Schneidmiller","fullName":"Schneidmiller, Evgeny","id":"2289","affiliation":"Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron","emailHash":"f8334cdfdbdfeda44bf3f593183be6b6","db_id":2289,"person_id":1340},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Enrico","last_name":"Allaria","fullName":"Allaria, Enrico","id":"2292","affiliation":"Elettra-Sincrotrone Trieste S.C.p.A.","emailHash":"f3da95a24a366d2b8598e5ea79ae7aa8","db_id":2292,"person_id":1500}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Georgia","last_name":"Paraskaki","fullName":"Paraskaki, Georgia","id":"2291","affiliation":"Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron","emailHash":"760cd3f52c669ddf1262f21a4e8cb1ed","db_id":2291,"person_id":1749},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Eugenio","last_name":"Ferrari","fullName":"Ferrari, Eugenio","id":"2777","affiliation":"Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron","emailHash":null,"db_id":2777,"person_id":2049},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Lucas","last_name":"Schaper","fullName":"Schaper, Lucas","id":"2290","affiliation":"Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron","emailHash":"e80e5283507b8228b752a43ee34fd627","db_id":2290,"person_id":1287},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Evgeny","last_name":"Schneidmiller","fullName":"Schneidmiller, Evgeny","id":"2289","affiliation":"Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron","emailHash":"f8334cdfdbdfeda44bf3f593183be6b6","db_id":2289,"person_id":1340},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Enrico","last_name":"Allaria","fullName":"Allaria, Enrico","id":"2292","affiliation":"Elettra-Sincrotrone Trieste S.C.p.A.","emailHash":"f3da95a24a366d2b8598e5ea79ae7aa8","db_id":2292,"person_id":1500}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":"Seeded FEL","session":"Tuesday posters","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"TUP49","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"136","db_id":516,"friendly_id":136,"title":"Generation of High-Power Free-Electron Laser Pulses with Orbital Angular Momentum","startDate":{"date":"2022-08-23","time":"17:40:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2022-08-23","time":"18:00:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Exhibition Hall","room":"Exhibition Hall","note":{},"location":"Trieste Convention Centre","type":"Contributed Poster","description":"The generation of x-ray pulses carrying orbital angular momentum from an x-ray free-electron laser (FEL) has attracted considerable attention due to the ability to directly change atomic states and develop new material characterization techniques.

Here we present an innovative hybrid staging approach, deploying electron beams generated in a laser-driven wakefield accelerator (LWFA) as drivers for a PWFA, integrated in a particularly compact setup. This scenario exploits the capability of LWFAs to deliver shortest, high peak-current electron bunches [1] with the prospects for high-quality witness beam generation in PWFAs [2]. The feasibility of the concept is presented through exemplary particle-in-cell simulations, before describing experimental results from extensive campaigns performed at high-power laser facilities; ATLAS (LMU, Munich), SALLE-JAUNE (LOA, Paris) and DRACO (HZDR, Dresden). Using few-cycle optical probing we captured clear images of beam-driven plasma waves in a dedicated plasma stage, allowing us to identify a non-linear plasma-wave excitation regime. Trailing the plasma waves, the impact of ion motion to the transverse modulation of the plasma density was observed over many picoseconds [3]. Furthermore, we demonstrate for the first time the acceleration of distinct witness beams in such LWFA-driven PWFA (LPWFA) setup [4,5], showcasing an accelerating gradient on the order of 100 GV\/m. These milestones pave the way towards compact sources of energetic ultra-high brightness electron beams as well as a miniature model for large scale PWFA facilities.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/480\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Arie","last_name":"Irman","fullName":"Irman, Arie","id":"1581","affiliation":"Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf","emailHash":"bdb93dae7e65396fd4eed70404d54d45","db_id":1581,"person_id":1736}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Arie","last_name":"Irman","fullName":"Irman, Arie","id":"1581","affiliation":"Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf","emailHash":"bdb93dae7e65396fd4eed70404d54d45","db_id":1581,"person_id":1736}],"coauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"","last_name":"on behalf of the hybrid collaboration","fullName":"on behalf of the hybrid collaboration","id":"1582","affiliation":"","emailHash":null,"db_id":1582,"person_id":1737}],"keywords":[],"track":"Novel acceleration and FEL concepts","session":"Tuesday posters","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"TUP23","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"130","db_id":571,"friendly_id":130,"title":"Control of the Longitudinal Phase and Benchmarking to HBSASE","startDate":{"date":"2022-08-23","time":"17:40:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2022-08-23","time":"18:00:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Exhibition Hall","room":"Exhibition Hall","note":{},"location":"Trieste Convention Centre","type":"Contributed Poster","description":"Improvement of the longitudinal coherence in the proposed Soft Xray FEL, the SXL, for the MAX IV Laboratory is an important design aspect to enhance the user case. One of the main considered methods is HBSASE. However the final compression in the MAX IV acceleratos is done at full energy, and thus leaving an energy chirp in the electron pulse. This chirp in longitudinal phase space has to be removed for an efficient implementation of HBSASE. In this paper we show in simulations how the phase space is improved by first overcompressing the pulse, and then correct it by a two-plate wake field de-chirper. The resulting pulse is then shown to have qualities such that, by HBSASE, a significant narrowing of the FEL bandwidth is achieved at 1 nm.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/571\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Francesca","last_name":"Curbis","fullName":"Curbis, Francesca","id":"2329","affiliation":"Lund University","emailHash":"2d715187d00af0b1e3b82d66598bec2d","db_id":2329,"person_id":1491},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Mihai","last_name":"Pop","fullName":"Pop, Mihai","id":"2326","affiliation":"MAX IV Laboratory","emailHash":"5ff6813da948575f2f47499c3ce897ca","db_id":2326,"person_id":1724},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Sverker","last_name":"Werin","fullName":"Werin, Sverker","id":"2328","affiliation":"MAX IV Laboratory","emailHash":"bcac2d127e195e5d0b2bcd3b0301c14d","db_id":2328,"person_id":1492},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Saeid","last_name":"Pirani","fullName":"Pirani, Saeid","id":"2327","affiliation":"Lund University","emailHash":"0a52e6e785476d9208d3c0e4042652a2","db_id":2327,"person_id":1725}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Francesca","last_name":"Curbis","fullName":"Curbis, Francesca","id":"2329","affiliation":"Lund University","emailHash":"2d715187d00af0b1e3b82d66598bec2d","db_id":2329,"person_id":1491},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Mihai","last_name":"Pop","fullName":"Pop, Mihai","id":"2326","affiliation":"MAX IV Laboratory","emailHash":"5ff6813da948575f2f47499c3ce897ca","db_id":2326,"person_id":1724},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Sverker","last_name":"Werin","fullName":"Werin, Sverker","id":"2328","affiliation":"MAX IV Laboratory","emailHash":"bcac2d127e195e5d0b2bcd3b0301c14d","db_id":2328,"person_id":1492},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Saeid","last_name":"Pirani","fullName":"Pirani, Saeid","id":"2327","affiliation":"Lund University","emailHash":"0a52e6e785476d9208d3c0e4042652a2","db_id":2327,"person_id":1725}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":"Seeded FEL","session":"Tuesday posters","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"TUP62","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"126","db_id":425,"friendly_id":126,"title":"Energy-Chirp-Based Outcoupling Scheme for X-Ray Regenerative Amplifier FEL","startDate":{"date":"2022-08-23","time":"17:40:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2022-08-23","time":"18:00:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Exhibition Hall","room":"Exhibition Hall","note":{},"location":"Trieste Convention Centre","type":"Contributed Poster","description":"Cavity-based X-ray Free Electron Lasers (FELs) such as the X-ray regenerative amplifier FEL (XRAFEL) [1] and the X-ray FEL oscillator [2] have drawn great interest as a means of producing high-brightness, fully coherent and stable hard x-ray pulses for high-repetition rate FELs [3]. However, high efficiency outcoupling of the stored cavity x-ray radiation remains challenging. Here we present a novel XRAFEL design to achieve efficient cavity outcoupling or Q-switching by introducing energy chirp in the electron beam while leaving the high-quality X-ray optics intact. During the FEL interaction, electron beam with an linear energy chirp can be slightly compressed or decompressed by the undulator, which leads to a gradual shift of radiation frequency outside the bandwidth of the Bragg crystal for efficient outcoupling. Our simulation results show that substantial power can be outcoupled from the X-ray cavity driven by chirped electron beams at 100 kHz repetition rate.

A seeding scheme can be used instead of SASE to improve the coherent properties and shot-to-shot stability. Several options for seeding are considered in simulation for the THz FEL at PITZ: external laser pulse, pre-bunched electron beam, energy modulated electron beam and additional short spike. The results of the simulations for each method of seeding are evaluated and compared. The improvements over SASE in energy, spectral and temporal stability of the THz pulse are presented.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/422\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Georgi","last_name":"Georgiev","fullName":"Georgiev, Georgi","id":"1254","affiliation":"Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron DESY at Zeuthen","emailHash":"00096768d018925b6fffc65606465b64","db_id":1254,"person_id":1707},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Prach","last_name":"Boonpornprasert","fullName":"Boonpornprasert, Prach","id":"1252","affiliation":"Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron DESY at Zeuthen","emailHash":"27d70e1abb703f25c389241fdf3434f5","db_id":1252,"person_id":1259},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Mikhail","last_name":"Krasilnikov","fullName":"Krasilnikov, Mikhail","id":"1255","affiliation":"Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron DESY at Zeuthen","emailHash":"d8c14b8cca168b60db6b74334d8d603b","db_id":1255,"person_id":1295},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Xiangkun","last_name":"Li","fullName":"Li, Xiangkun","id":"1253","affiliation":"Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron DESY at Zeuthen","emailHash":null,"db_id":1253,"person_id":1323},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Wolfgang","last_name":"Hillert","fullName":"Hillert, Wolfgang","id":"1251","affiliation":"University of Hamburg","emailHash":"ed6f72ec740e0d0a1cf97f8976aac47c","db_id":1251,"person_id":1706}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Georgi","last_name":"Georgiev","fullName":"Georgiev, Georgi","id":"1254","affiliation":"Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron DESY at Zeuthen","emailHash":"00096768d018925b6fffc65606465b64","db_id":1254,"person_id":1707},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Prach","last_name":"Boonpornprasert","fullName":"Boonpornprasert, Prach","id":"1252","affiliation":"Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron DESY at Zeuthen","emailHash":"27d70e1abb703f25c389241fdf3434f5","db_id":1252,"person_id":1259},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Mikhail","last_name":"Krasilnikov","fullName":"Krasilnikov, Mikhail","id":"1255","affiliation":"Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron DESY at Zeuthen","emailHash":"d8c14b8cca168b60db6b74334d8d603b","db_id":1255,"person_id":1295},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Xiangkun","last_name":"Li","fullName":"Li, Xiangkun","id":"1253","affiliation":"Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron DESY at Zeuthen","emailHash":null,"db_id":1253,"person_id":1323},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Wolfgang","last_name":"Hillert","fullName":"Hillert, Wolfgang","id":"1251","affiliation":"University of Hamburg","emailHash":"ed6f72ec740e0d0a1cf97f8976aac47c","db_id":1251,"person_id":1706}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":"Seeded FEL","session":"Tuesday posters","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"TUP40","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"119","db_id":384,"friendly_id":119,"title":"Simulations of Ultrahigh Brightness Beams from a Plasma Photocathode Injector","startDate":{"date":"2022-08-23","time":"16:20:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2022-08-23","time":"16:40:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Exhibition Hall","room":"Exhibition Hall","note":{},"location":"Trieste Convention Centre","type":"Contributed Poster","description":"Plasma photocathode injectors may enable electron beams with normalised emittance at the nm-rad level from a Plasma Wakefield Acceleration (PWFA) stage [1]. These electron beams typically have kA-level peak currents leading to ultrahigh 5D brightness beams with the potential to drive advanced light sources [1]. The feasibility of the plasma photocathode was demonstrated at FACET-I at SLAC [2]. Further experimental campaigns are gradually aiming toward ultrahigh 5D and 6D brightness beams at FACET-II [3]. However, a series of milestones must be reached before these beams can be utilised for XFELs. For example, electron beams accelerated in plasma-based accelerators inherently have a significant energy chirp due to the GV\/m accelerating gradients involved. Since energy chirp and energy spread can be detrimental to the high-gain FEL interaction, advanced approaches have been developed for energy spread minimisation of the initially ultrahigh 5D brightness beams towards ultrahigh 6D brightness [4]. Here we show within the framework of the PWFA-FEL project that it may also be possible to produce ultrahigh 5D brightness beams with reduced energy spread using beam-loading. We present results aiming at a trade-off between reduced energy spread, increased peak current, and increased emittance and their application to a soft XFEL in the water window.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/384\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Lily","last_name":"Berman","fullName":"Berman, Lily","id":"965","affiliation":"University of Strathclyde","emailHash":"0180686b2f1e3996f916c204add10f2e","db_id":965,"person_id":1703},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"A.

In particular, FELs strongly enhanced the capabilities of several analytical techniques, which took advantage of the high degree of transverse coherence provided. FELs based on the harmonic up-conversion of an external seed laser are characterised also by a high degree of longitudinal coherence, since electrons inherit the coherence properties of the seed. At the present state of the art, the shortest wavelength delivered to user experiments by an externally seeded FEL light source is about 4 nm. We show here that pulses with a high longitudinal degree of coherence (first and second order) covering the water window and with photon energy extending up to 790 eV can be generated by exploiting the so-called nonlinear harmonic regime, which allows generation of radiation at harmonics of the resonant FEL wavelength. \r\nMoreover, we report the results of two proof-of-principle experiments: one measuring the oxygen K-edge absorption in water ($\\sim$ 530 eV), the other analysing the spin dynamics of Fe and Co through magnetic small angle x-ray scattering at their L-edges (707 eV and 780

Here we present theoretical analyses and start-to-end simulation results for the generation of phase-locked pulses using the Hard X-ray Self-Seeding (HXRSS) system at the European XFEL. As proposed in  Ref. [1], the method is based on a combination of self-seeding and fresh-slice lasing techniques. However, at variance with Ref. [1], here we exploit different transverse centroid offsets along the electron beam.  In this way we may first utilize part of the electron beam to produce SASE radiation, to be filtered as seed and then generate HXRSS pulses from other parts of the beam applying appropriate transverse kicks. The final result consists in coherent radiation pulses with fixed phase difference and tunable time delay within the bunch length. This scheme should be useful for applications such as coherent x-ray pump-probe experiments.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/481\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Tianyun","last_name":"Long","fullName":"Long,

laboratory in Trieste, operating in the VUV to soft X-rays spectral range. In order to extend the FEL spectral range to shorter wavelengths, an upgrade plan for increasing the Linac energy from 1.5 GeV to 2.0 GeV is actually going on. After successful testing of the short prototype of new high gradient S-band accelerating structure up to an accelerating gradient of 40 MV\/m, a full length 3.0 m HG structure has been built in collaboration with Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI). In the first step, two such new structures would be installed in place of S0a and one deflector at K15 increasing the beam energy to 1.7 GeV. In the next phase 14 new HG structures would replace the present Backward Travelling Wave sections reaching to the final goal of 2.0 GeV. Currently first 3.0 m HG structure is under conditioning and high power testing at Cavity Test Facility of Elettra. In this paper we report the low power measurement results as well as conditioning results of 3.0 m HG structure.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/462\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Nuaman","last_name":"Shafqat","fullName":"Shafqat, Nuaman","id":"1499","affiliation":"Elettra-Sincrotrone Trieste S.C.p.A.","emailHash":"ab10794845dcbda209d06c63f62b0a3c","db_id":1499,"person_id":1465}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Nuaman","last_name":"Shafqat","fullName":"Shafqat, Nuaman","id":"1499","affiliation":"Elettra-Sincrotrone Trieste S.C.p.A.","emailHash":"ab10794845dcbda209d06c63f62b0a3c","db_id":1499,"person_id":1465},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Claudio","last_name":"Masciovecchio","fullName":"Masciovecchio, Claudio","id":"1500","affiliation":"Elettra-Sincrotrone Trieste S.C.p.A.","emailHash":"8d5ac747d50dbd76fb617c4e218fdbc7","db_id":1500,"person_id":1468},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Massimo","last_name":"Milloch","fullName":"Milloch, Massimo","id":"1496","affiliation":"Elettra-Sincrotrone Trieste S.C.p.A.","emailHash":"3bb6b97683919292d03d8030566fb743","db_id":1496,"person_id":1470},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Federico","last_name":"Gelmetti","fullName":"Gelmetti, Federico","id":"1495","affiliation":"Elettra-Sincrotrone Trieste S.C.p.A.","emailHash":"f18594773737719195e3cca074cfe3a1","db_id":1495,"person_id":1469},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Andrea","last_name":"Milocco","fullName":"Milocco, Andrea","id":"1498","affiliation":"Elettra-Sincrotrone Trieste S.C.p.A.","emailHash":"61e6b283a3be14c398b4685910bd20f6","db_id":1498,"person_id":1466},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Mauro","last_name":"Trovo","fullName":"Trovo, Mauro","id":"1497","affiliation":"Elettra-Sincrotrone Trieste S.C.p.A.","emailHash":null,"db_id":1497,"person_id":1467}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":"Electron sources","session":"Tuesday posters","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"TUP08","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"59","db_id":579,"friendly_id":59,"title":"Generation of a Sub-Picosecond Sheet Electron Beam Using a 100 fs Laser","startDate":{"date":"2022-08-23","time":"17:40:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2022-08-23","time":"18:00:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Exhibition Hall","room":"Exhibition Hall","note":{},"location":"Trieste Convention Centre","type":"Contributed Poster","description":"The biggest benefit of DC photoelectron-gun driven by the sub-picosecond laser is that such type of guns can be operated with the current density much higher than the Child\u2019s low limitation.  We demonstrated 0.3 nC bunch generation by irradiating a 100 fs Ti:sapphire laser focused to 0.1 square-cm area onto a tangsten photocathode installed in a diode type 40 kV DC gun. The drawback is the strong Coulomb repulsive force by which electrons may suffer the emittance degradation in the vicinity of the cathode. To reduce the repulsive force at the cathode surface, we are trying to generate a \u201csheet-like\u201d photoelectron bunch. In our experiments, electron bunches are generated by irradiating the laser pulse shaped in an ellipse onto the photocathode. The ellipticity is set in the range of 0.03-0.05 while the most of sheet-beam experiments were conducted with the ellipticity about 0.1. The smaller the ellipcity, the longer the circumference; this may reduce the radial electric field on the electron bunch side-wall. Moreover the electron bunch shape is rather a \u201cline\u201d than a \u201csheet\u201d due to the short duration of the drive laser pulse. We  conducted a preliminaly experiment and observed  that the elliptical photo-electron bunch had much larger divergence angle in the minor axis direction. In the presentation, experimental results, the numerical simulation on the particle motion and the design of the sheet-photo-electron DC gun will be discussed.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/579\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Makoto","last_name":"Asakawa","fullName":"Asakawa,

theoretical understanding and experimental demonstration of seeded FELs . The ultimate spectral limit of seeded FEL, however, remains unclear, because of the broadening and distortions induced in the output spectrum by residual broadband energy modulations in the electron beam.\r\nIn this talk, we present the mathematical descriptions of the impact of broadband energy modulations on the EEHG, HGHG and self seeding  bunching spectrums produced by the microbunching instability through both the accelerator and the FEL line. We will show the agreement of our models with the systematic experimental characterization seeded FEL spectrums in FERMI and Eu-XFEL. Using experimental data  of EEHG FEL performance in FERMI in the photon energy range 130\u2013210 eV, we demonstrate  that amplification of electron beam energy distortions primarily in the EEHG dispersive sections explains an observed reduction of the FEL spectral brightness proportional to the EEHG harmonic number. Local maxima of the FEL spectral brightness and of the spectral stability are found for a suitable balance of the dispersive sections\u2019 strength and the first seed laser pulse energy[1].\r\n[1]  Physical Review Accelerators and Beams 24, 8, 2021","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/551\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Najmeh","last_name":"Mirian","fullName":"Mirian, Najmeh","id":"2131","affiliation":"Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron","emailHash":"07bf04b3dd56022001fc710e08e6be97","db_id":2131,"person_id":1139}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Najmeh","last_name":"Mirian","fullName":"Mirian, Najmeh","id":"2131","affiliation":"Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron","emailHash":"07bf04b3dd56022001fc710e08e6be97","db_id":2131,"person_id":1139}],"coauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Enrico","last_name":"Allaria","fullName":"Allaria, Enrico","id":"2130","affiliation":"","emailHash":null,"db_id":2130,"person_id":1140},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Giovanni","last_name":"De Ninno","fullName":"De Ninno, Giovanni","id":"2128","affiliation":"Elettra-Sincrotrone Trieste S.C.p.A.","emailHash":"6f2284cfb092e188a827a9b878e85fa8","db_id":2128,"person_id":447},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Giovanni","last_name":"Perosa","fullName":"Perosa, Giovanni","id":"2129","affiliation":"University of Trieste, Elettra Sincrotrone Trieste","emailHash":"ad53955ce8eaaefab72d84a47dd5e3e2","db_id":2129,"person_id":1132},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Luca","last_name":"Giannessi","fullName":"Giannessi, Luca","id":"2133","affiliation":"Elettra Sincrotrone Trieste and Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare","emailHash":"c5350c011f76a90ef163bde22a2ea215","db_id":2133,"person_id":448},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Primoz","last_name":"Rebernik","fullName":"Rebernik, Primoz","id":"2132","affiliation":"Elettra","emailHash":null,"db_id":2132,"person_id":1138},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Simone","last_name":"Di Mitri","fullName":"Di Mitri, Simone","id":"2127","affiliation":"Elettra-Sincrotrone Trieste S.C.p.A.","emailHash":"04a73bfcde6c346288ea012239f50fe1","db_id":2127,"person_id":450}],"keywords":[],"track":"Seeded FEL","session":"Tuesday posters","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"TUP46","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"75","db_id":432,"friendly_id":75,"title":"Laser-Based Seeding of SwissFEL Athos","startDate":{"date":"2022-08-23","time":"17:40:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2022-08-23","time":"18:00:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Exhibition Hall","room":"Exhibition Hall","note":{},"location":"Trieste Convention Centre","type":"Contributed Poster","description":"In the scope of the HERO ERC project, we are implementing a laser-based seeding scheme at the SwissFEL soft X-ray Athos beamline to generate fully coherent X-ray FEL pulses.

built. The ICS source consists of a 100kV photo gun electron injector, X-band accelerator, and interaction laser. One of the first upgrades for this ICS source is operating in a so-called burst mode. In burst mode, the electron injector is replaced by the advanced continuous electron (ACE) injector and a Fabry-Perot cavity is added to the laser. Both systems work in a 100 nanosecond long burst. Significantly increasing the current x-ray yield and the brilliance of the ICS source.\r\nThe ACE injector works by generating a continuous beam with a high current and low emittance through thermionic emission. The continuous electron beam is then chopped into a pulsed beam by a combination of a dual-mode elliptical RF cavity and a knife-edge. The dual-mode cavity uses both the fundamental mode (1.5 GHz) and its second harmonic (3.0 GHz) to increase the duty cycle of the chopping process to approximately 30% with a minimal loss of beam quality. Finally, a second dual-mode elliptical RF cavity compresses the pulse length of the bunches, preparing the beam for injection into an X-band linear accelerator.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/474\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Rick","last_name":"van den Berg","fullName":"van den Berg, Rick","id":"1558","affiliation":"Technische Universiteit Eindhoven","emailHash":"ffbe81eb30541ae91be004f60a8cb441","db_id":1558,"person_id":1268}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Rick","last_name":"van den Berg","fullName":"van den Berg, Rick","id":"1558","affiliation":"Technische Universiteit Eindhoven","emailHash":"ffbe81eb30541ae91be004f60a8cb441","db_id":1558,"person_id":1268},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Wiebe","last_name":"Toonen","fullName":"Toonen, Wiebe","id":"1560","affiliation":"Technische Universiteit Eindhoven","emailHash":"0af8c96c191cdc554bb7f52c43693bb4","db_id":1560,"person_id":2134}],"coauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Jom","last_name":"Luiten","fullName":"Luiten, Jom","id":"1557","affiliation":"Technische Universiteit Eindhoven","emailHash":"e693db5b25c403948951ad7287d07feb","db_id":1557,"person_id":1269},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Peter","last_name":"Mutsaers","fullName":"Mutsaers, Peter","id":"1559","affiliation":"Technische Universiteit Eindhoven","emailHash":"f1c69ceaf328b3fd89c784e23f9192bd","db_id":1559,"person_id":1270}],"keywords":[],"track":"Electron sources","session":"Tuesday posters","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"TUP13","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"63","db_id":391,"friendly_id":63,"title":"A Pulse Shaper for Direct Generation of 515 nm 3D Ellipsoidal Pulses at PITZ","startDate":{"date":"2022-08-23","time":"17:20:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2022-08-23","time":"17:40:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Exhibition Hall","room":"Exhibition Hall","note":{},"location":"Trieste Convention Centre","type":"Contributed Poster","description":"In this paper, a cathode laser pulse shaper at 515 nm is presented that will be used for emittance optimizations. In case alkali antimonide photocathodes are used, the shaped green pulses can be applied directly for photoemission while Cs<sub>2<\/sub>Te photocathodes requires second harmonic generation to provide UV laser pulses. Recent tests of CsK<sub>2<\/sub>Sb photocathodes in the high gradient RF gun at PITZ are first steps for the future usage of green laser pulses, which would simplify the requirements for the photocathode laser system, especially for CW operation cases envisioned in future. As long the alkali antimonide photocathodes are not in regular use yet, the laser pulses need to be converted into the UV. The green pulse shaper still simplifies the laser system since two conversion stages from IR to green to UV were needed in the past, which dilutes the quality of the shaped laser pulses. In this paper, a pulse shaper for direct generation of 515nm 3D ellipsoidal pulses is presented that is expected to further improve the beam emittance generated by ellipsoidal laser shaping.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/391\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Christian","last_name":"Koschitzki","fullName":"Koschitzki, Christian","id":"994","affiliation":"Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron DESY at Zeuthen","emailHash":"d8ff7d617d6a77004a578f5da998f0fe","db_id":994,"person_id":1311}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Andreas","last_name":"Hoffmann","fullName":"Hoffmann, Andreas","id":"996","affiliation":"Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron DESY at Zeuthen","emailHash":"327eb8394df0c34791ce312199a53aaf","db_id":996,"person_id":1415}],"coauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"James","last_name":"Good","fullName":"Good, James","id":"995","affiliation":"Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron DESY at Zeuthen","emailHash":"e31cafca53e2790af0c31f8d583f5544","db_id":995,"person_id":1325},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Matthias","last_name":"Gross","fullName":"Gross, Matthias","id":"991","affiliation":"Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron DESY at Zeuthen","emailHash":"f5ce1eea398b76f0e94fc21baecb8f5e","db_id":991,"person_id":1318},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Christian","last_name":"Koschitzki","fullName":"Koschitzki, Christian","id":"994","affiliation":"Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron DESY at Zeuthen","emailHash":"d8ff7d617d6a77004a578f5da998f0fe","db_id":994,"person_id":1311},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Mikhail","last_name":"Krasilnikov","fullName":"Krasilnikov, Mikhail","id":"990","affiliation":"Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron DESY at Zeuthen","emailHash":"d8c14b8cca168b60db6b74334d8d603b","db_id":990,"person_id":1295},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Houjun","last_name":"Qian","fullName":"Qian, Houjun","id":"992","affiliation":"Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron DESY at Zeuthen","emailHash":null,"db_id":992,"person_id":1326},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Frank","last_name":"Stephan","fullName":"Stephan, Frank","id":"993","affiliation":"Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron DESY at Zeuthen","emailHash":"ffe13adf3c2385c4b4c6eab1d3a8b4bf","db_id":993,"person_id":1307}],"keywords":[],"track":"Electron sources","session":"Tuesday posters","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"TUP01","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"68","db_id":510,"friendly_id":68,"title":"High Repetition Rate Seeded Free-Electron Laser with a Harmonic Optical Klystron in High-Gain Harmonic Generation","startDate":{"date":"2022-08-23","time":"17:40:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2022-08-23","time":"18:00:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Exhibition Hall","room":"Exhibition Hall","note":{},"location":"Trieste Convention Centre","type":"Contributed Poster","description":"External seeding techniques like high-gain harmonic generation (HGHG) and echo-enabled harmonic generation (EEHG) have been proven to be able to generate fully coherent radiation in the EUV and X-ray range. However, towards seeding at a high repetition rate, the repetition rate of current laser systems with sufficient power for seeding is limited to the kilohertz range. One attractive solution to this limitation is to reduce the required seed laser power. In this contribution, we will present a harmonic optical klystron scheme with high gain harmonic generation. With the harmonic optical klystron scheme as the seeding technique, the required seed laser power is decreased, and higher harmonics than in a standard single-stage HGHG can be achieved.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/510\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Hao","last_name":"Sun","fullName":"Sun, Hao","id":"1857","affiliation":"Shanghai Institute of Applied Physics","emailHash":"7a359e715f255e8f3e21b47c80fc6bd9","db_id":1857,"person_id":1442},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Georgia","last_name":"Paraskaki","fullName":"Paraskaki, Georgia","id":"2435","affiliation":"Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron","emailHash":"760cd3f52c669ddf1262f21a4e8cb1ed","db_id":2435,"person_id":1749},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Bart","last_name":"Faatz","fullName":"Faatz, Bart","id":"2542","affiliation":"Shanghai Advanced Research Institute","emailHash":"08baab2db6d281ad938275ffa197a175","db_id":2542,"person_id":2270},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Chao","last_name":"Feng","fullName":"Feng, Chao","id":"2436","affiliation":"Shanghai Advanced Research Institute","emailHash":"d6abf5c5ad8355374514c841aaa9b543","db_id":2436,"person_id":1440},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Bo","last_name":"Liu","fullName":"Liu, Bo","id":"2541","affiliation":"Shanghai Advanced Research Institute","emailHash":"9cbcc5ec7baf6b2fed2fc26cfcdc12bd","db_id":2541,"person_id":2271}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Hao","last_name":"Sun","fullName":"Sun, Hao","id":"1857","affiliation":"Shanghai Institute of Applied Physics","emailHash":"7a359e715f255e8f3e21b47c80fc6bd9","db_id":1857,"person_id":1442},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Georgia","last_name":"Paraskaki","fullName":"Paraskaki, Georgia","id":"2435","affiliation":"Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron","emailHash":"760cd3f52c669ddf1262f21a4e8cb1ed","db_id":2435,"person_id":1749},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Bart","last_name":"Faatz","fullName":"Faatz, Bart","id":"2542","affiliation":"Shanghai Advanced Research Institute","emailHash":"08baab2db6d281ad938275ffa197a175","db_id":2542,"person_id":2270},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Chao","last_name":"Feng","fullName":"Feng, Chao","id":"2436","affiliation":"Shanghai Advanced Research Institute","emailHash":"d6abf5c5ad8355374514c841aaa9b543","db_id":2436,"person_id":1440},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Bo","last_name":"Liu","fullName":"Liu, Bo","id":"2541","affiliation":"Shanghai Advanced Research Institute","emailHash":"9cbcc5ec7baf6b2fed2fc26cfcdc12bd","db_id":2541,"person_id":2271}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":"Seeded FEL","session":"Tuesday posters","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"TUP69","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"12","db_id":476,"friendly_id":12,"title":"Analysis of Spectral Contents in Hard Xray Self-Seeded Free-Electron Laser Operation at the European XFEL","startDate":{"date":"2022-08-23","time":"17:40:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2022-08-23","time":"18:00:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Exhibition Hall","room":"Exhibition Hall","note":{},"location":"Trieste Convention Centre","type":"Contributed Poster","description":"Recently, Hard x-ray self-seeding (HXRSS) operations at the European X-ray free-electron laser  (EuXFEL) opened a pathway towards the application of pulses with high spectral density (in terms of ph\/eV per pulse) in the fields of applied physics, chemistry and biology, where the coherent radiation spectrum is essential. The spectrum of hard x-ray self seeding pulses is generally accompanied by a pedestal around the central seeded photon energy. The pedestal contains two separate components: normal self-amplified spontaneous (SASE) and sideband emissions that can be ascribed to long-wavelength modulations of the electron beam. The pedestal limits the spectral purity and can impact some user applications. In this report, we analyze the purity of HXRSS pulses in the presence of microbunching instability. We look at the spectral contents after and before saturation, and display the contribution of the pedestal in the HXRSS spectrum.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/476\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Najmeh","last_name":"Mirian","fullName":"Mirian, Najmeh","id":"1565","affiliation":"Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron","emailHash":"07bf04b3dd56022001fc710e08e6be97","db_id":1565,"person_id":1139},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Tianyun ","last_name":"Long","fullName":"Long, Tianyun ","id":"1566","affiliation":"","emailHash":"22680c80b95d52d59ec8e677899be7bf","db_id":1566,"person_id":1141}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Najmeh","last_name":"Mirian","fullName":"Mirian, Najmeh","id":"1565","affiliation":"Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron","emailHash":"07bf04b3dd56022001fc710e08e6be97","db_id":1565,"person_id":1139},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Tianyun ","last_name":"Long","fullName":"Long, Tianyun ","id":"1566","affiliation":"","emailHash":"22680c80b95d52d59ec8e677899be7bf","db_id":1566,"person_id":1141}],"coauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Shan","last_name":"Liu","fullName":"Liu, Shan","id":"1567","affiliation":"Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron","emailHash":"8e112890628575074c32d35aaf230c86","db_id":1567,"person_id":1143},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Weilun","last_name":"Qin","fullName":"Qin, Weilun","id":"1569","affiliation":"","emailHash":"eae3fd26fd07347555e5c0eb5b6bdb5c","db_id":1569,"person_id":1145},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Svitozar","last_name":"Serkez","fullName":"Serkez, Svitozar","id":"1564","affiliation":"","emailHash":"b785e1f823ef856de0f906c5417cfd4e","db_id":1564,"person_id":1559},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"gianluca","last_name":"geloni","fullName":"geloni, gianluca","id":"1568","affiliation":"","emailHash":"7108bfd6314f198cd17ba53a938bdd50","db_id":1568,"person_id":1142},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Marc","last_name":"Guetg","fullName":"Guetg, Marc","id":"1570","affiliation":"","emailHash":"0609875fcc906eb507626adf9118331b","db_id":1570,"person_id":1146}],"keywords":[],"track":"Seeded FEL","session":"Tuesday posters","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"TUP47","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"27","db_id":482,"friendly_id":27,"title":"A Novel Method for Generating High-Repetition-Rate and Fully Coherent EUV Free-Electron Laser","startDate":{"date":"2022-08-23","time":"17:40:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2022-08-23","time":"18:00:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Exhibition Hall","room":"Exhibition Hall","note":{},"location":"Trieste Convention Centre","type":"Contributed Poster","description":"High-brightness extreme ultraviolet (EUV) light source is strongly required for high-resolution photoelectron spectroscopy, imaging experiments, and EUV lithography.

University, the seeding scheme CHG (coherent harmonic generation), the counterpart to HGHG (high-gain harmonic generation) without FEL gain, is used to provide ultrashort pulses in the femtosecond regime at harmonics of the seedlaser wavelength. To provide higher harmonics and thus shorter wavelengths, it is planned to upgrade the short-pulse facility to the EEHG (echo-enabled harmonic generation) scheme, which has yet not been implement at any storage ring. To install the needed three undulators and two chicanes, about a quarter of the storage ring needs to be modified. The paper presents the layout of the envisaged EEHG facility and the demo project SPEED (Short-Pulse Emission via Echo at DELTA) where all components are realized in a single undulator.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/573\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Arjun","last_name":"Radha Krishnan","fullName":"Radha Krishnan, Arjun","id":"2335","affiliation":"TU Dortmund University","emailHash":"500f563d237a85cc9d62311059dcbb4a","db_id":2335,"person_id":1982}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Benedikt","last_name":"B\u00fcsing","fullName":"B\u00fcsing, Benedikt","id":"2339","affiliation":"TU Dortmund University","emailHash":"2f27e590711e4c3844df49c917e4efc0","db_id":2339,"person_id":1981},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Arjun","last_name":"Radha Krishnan","fullName":"Radha Krishnan, Arjun","id":"2335","affiliation":"TU Dortmund University","emailHash":"500f563d237a85cc9d62311059dcbb4a","db_id":2335,"person_id":1982},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Shaukat","last_name":"Khan","fullName":"Khan, Shaukat","id":"2342","affiliation":"TU Dortmund University","emailHash":"ee5be04a1e68412a7fa55946da9a3127","db_id":2342,"person_id":1983},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Carsten","last_name":"Mai","fullName":"Mai, Carsten","id":"2337","affiliation":"TU Dortmund University","emailHash":null,"db_id":2337,"person_id":1984},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Zohair","last_name":"Usfoor","fullName":"Usfoor, Zohair","id":"2756","affiliation":"TU Dortmund University","emailHash":"c86a80f2f1de72fa45081c61ed531677","db_id":2756,"person_id":2355},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Arne","last_name":"Held","fullName":"Held, Arne","id":"2757","affiliation":"TU Dortmund University","emailHash":"b45d0ea1914078550cac3b2880a8dd8b","db_id":2757,"person_id":2354},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Vivek","last_name":"Vijayan","fullName":"Vijayan, Vivek","id":"2758","affiliation":"TU Dortmund University","emailHash":"02487dcbecbc098557b83ab36b72a4d3","db_id":2758,"person_id":2356}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":"Seeded FEL","session":"Tuesday posters","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"TUP70","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"143","db_id":547,"friendly_id":143,"title":"First Demonstration of Parallel Operation of a Seeded FEL and a SASE FEL","startDate":{"date":"2022-08-23","time":"17:40:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2022-08-23","time":"18:00:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Exhibition Hall","room":"Exhibition Hall","note":{},"location":"Trieste Convention Centre","type":"Contributed Poster","description":"The FLASH facility houses a superconducting linac powering two FEL beamlines with MHz repetition rate in 10 Hz bursts. Within the FLASH2020+ project, which is taking care of facility development, one major aspect is the transformation of one of the two FEL beam lines to deliver externally seeded fully coherent FEL pulses to photon user experiments. At the same time the second beam line will use the SASE principle to provide photon pulses of different properties to users.\r\nSince the electron beam phase space conducive for SASE or seeded operation is drastically different, here a proof-of-principle experiment using the existing experimental seeding hardware has been performed demonstrating the possibility of simultaneous operation.\r\nIn this contribution we will describe the setup of the experiment and accelerator, and discuss the chances and limitations of the experimental seeding hardware. Finally, we will discuss the results and their implications also for the FLASH2020+ project.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/547\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Sheida","last_name":"Mahmoodi","fullName":"Mahmoodi,

an extremely powerful technique for the generation of ultrashort pulses in the infrared and visible spectral ranges. In this contribution we report the successful implementation of CPA in a seeded XUV FEL. A second experiment, using a two-stage harmonic generation scheme (FERMI FEL-2) has the objective to generate coherent and phase-tailored few-femtosecond FEL pulses, with gigawatt peak power in the sub-10 nm spectral range. This second experiment is still in progress. We will discuss the main scientific and technical bottlenecks and the implications.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/558\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"David","last_name":"Garzella","fullName":"Garzella,

high performance of linac-driven free electron lasers (FELs). The simulated uncorrelated energy spread in modern XFEL photoinjectors with beam energies of many tens of MeV is on the order of a few keV or even less. Thus, accurate measurement of the slice energy spread is not trivial. Two recent studies on high energy (>100 MeV) photoinjectors at SwissFEL and European XFEL have reported much higher slice energy spread than expected at their XFEL working points (200 \u2013 250 pC). A new method for measuring slice energy spread at a lower beam energy (\u223c20 MeV) is proposed and demonstrated at the Photo Injector Test facility at DESY Zeuthen (PITZ). The contribution will summarize previous results obtained on high energy injectors and then review the details of the technique used at PITZ as well as the experimental results for 250 pC, which are considerably lower than the results measured at high energy injectors.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/546\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Mikhail","last_name":"Krasilnikov","fullName":"Krasilnikov,

two modulators and two chicanes to manipulate the longitudinal phase space of an electron beam to achieve bunching at higher harmonics of the seed laser wavelength. Different combinations of energy modulation and longitudinal dispersion can result in the same amount of bunching at a certain harmonic. This study investigates the impact of the choice of the energy modulation amplitudes on the bunching properties and the spectro-temporal characteristics of the free-electron laser (FEL) radiation. Finally, a comparison between EEHG and the single modulator-chicane seeding scheme High-Gain Harmonic Generation (HGHG) at the 15th harmonic of the seed laser wavelength is presented. The corresponding numerical modelling and simulations are performed within the parameter range of the future upgrade of the FEL user facility FLASH at DESY.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/541\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Fabian","last_name":"Pannek","fullName":"Pannek, Fabian","id":"2065","affiliation":"University of Hamburg","emailHash":"20e4abc21a966f86c73a5c0082f34620","db_id":2065,"person_id":1778}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Fabian","last_name":"Pannek","fullName":"Pannek, Fabian","id":"2065","affiliation":"University of Hamburg","emailHash":"20e4abc21a966f86c73a5c0082f34620","db_id":2065,"person_id":1778}],"coauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Sven","last_name":"Ackermann","fullName":"Ackermann, Sven","id":"2066","affiliation":"Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron","emailHash":"c674fe75fbcebb312135b82011cb7713","db_id":2066,"person_id":1770},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Eugenio","last_name":"Ferrari","fullName":"Ferrari, Eugenio","id":"2069","affiliation":"Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron","emailHash":"8f799979a036f7a71d798b31a9441035","db_id":2069,"person_id":1779},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Lucas","last_name":"Schaper","fullName":"Schaper, Lucas","id":"2067","affiliation":"Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron","emailHash":"e80e5283507b8228b752a43ee34fd627","db_id":2067,"person_id":1287},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Wolfgang","last_name":"Hillert","fullName":"Hillert, Wolfgang","id":"2068","affiliation":"University of Hamburg","emailHash":"ed6f72ec740e0d0a1cf97f8976aac47c","db_id":2068,"person_id":1706}],"keywords":[],"track":"Seeded FEL","session":"Tuesday posters","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"TUP72","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"214","db_id":533,"friendly_id":214,"title":"LCLS-II MHz X-ray Temporal Shaping","startDate":{"date":"2022-08-23","time":"17:40:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2022-08-23","time":"18:00:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Exhibition Hall","room":"Exhibition Hall","note":{},"location":"Trieste Convention Centre","type":"Contributed Poster","description":"Shaping techniques traditionally used to produce few femtosecond and even sub femtosecond soft X-ray FEL pulses at LCLS do not scale well to high repetition rates.

This is accomplished with a high-power seed laser and an aggressively tapered undulator to compensate for the energy loss in the electron beam. A proof of concept experiment will be conducted at the Fermilab Accelerator Science and Technology Facility (FAST) using an undulator specifically built for this purpose. To support this experiment, the LINAC requires a unique setup that optimizes the longitudinal current distribution while preserving emittance in the presence of CSR and space-charge effects. This paper summarizes the beam dynamics optimization performed in support of TESSA and provides the nominal working point for the FEL experiment.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/513\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Christopher","last_name":"Hall","fullName":"Hall, Christopher","id":"1869","affiliation":"RadiaSoft LLC","emailHash":"4bd573a5b652333ac3fb84dc73f9aa6e","db_id":1869,"person_id":1700}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Alex","last_name":"Murokh","fullName":"Murokh, Alex","id":"1867","affiliation":"RadiaBeam Technologies","emailHash":"e5921355f58e34ffd560760a1a33ff36","db_id":1867,"person_id":1519},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Christopher","last_name":"Hall","fullName":"Hall, Christopher","id":"1869","affiliation":"RadiaSoft LLC","emailHash":"4bd573a5b652333ac3fb84dc73f9aa6e","db_id":1869,"person_id":1700},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Andrew","last_name":"Fisher","fullName":"Fisher, Andrew","id":"1865","affiliation":"Particle Beam Physics Lab (PBPL)","emailHash":"370c9b8597741a510ed639a7e8196caa","db_id":1865,"person_id":1514},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Ilya","last_name":"Pogorelov","fullName":"Pogorelov, Ilya","id":"1862","affiliation":"RadiaSoft LLC","emailHash":"46bfbdfbaa1523f136c43bd34ce7d727","db_id":1862,"person_id":1699},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Jonathan","last_name":"Edelen","fullName":"Edelen, Jonathan","id":"1868","affiliation":"RadiaSoft LLC","emailHash":"eba256da202ab8ffa7354eb7ef66fdf5","db_id":1868,"person_id":1701},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Pietro","last_name":"Musumeci","fullName":"Musumeci, Pietro","id":"1864","affiliation":"University of California, Los Angeles","emailHash":"ffe6745ab3dbfbb84ee29d263aa15780","db_id":1864,"person_id":1512},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Stephen","last_name":"Webb","fullName":"Webb, Stephen","id":"1863","affiliation":"RadiaSoft LLC","emailHash":null,"db_id":1863,"person_id":1698},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Youna","last_name":"Park","fullName":"Park, Youna","id":"1866","affiliation":"Particle Beam Physics Lab (PBPL)","emailHash":"ae7318dbc1c64b3fe76fe6ba53fe64c0","db_id":1866,"person_id":1516}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":"Seeded FEL","session":"Tuesday posters","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"TUP67","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"106","db_id":502,"friendly_id":106,"title":"FERMI FEL-1 Upgrade to EEHG","startDate":{"date":"2022-08-23","time":"17:40:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2022-08-23","time":"18:00:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Exhibition Hall","room":"Exhibition Hall","note":{},"location":"Trieste Convention Centre","type":"Contributed Poster","description":"In order to meet the user request of extending the FERMI FEL spectral range over the whole water window, we are developing an upgrade strategy that is based on the implementation of the Echo Enabled Harmonic Generation (EEHG) scheme.\r\nThe FERMI upgrade strategy is structured as follow: during a first phase, the single cascade FEL-1 branch will be adapted to operate either in EEHG or in HGHG. This upgrade can be achieved with relatively low cost and impact on FERMI operations and will improve the spectral range, spectral quality and scheme flexibility of FEL-1. Furthermore, it will provide a versatile test bench opening the possibility to explore in details the EEHG scheme potentialities and address many of the possible issues related to the second and more critical phase of the upgrade project: the upgrade of FEL-2. These two phases will proceed in parallel to the LINAC upgrade to increase the nominal energy. Solutions aiming at a peak beam energy of 1.8 and 2.0 GeV are under study.\r\nIn this contribution we will focus on the upgrade of the FEL-1 branch that has already started and is foreseen to provide light to users with the new configuration by spring 2023.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/502\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Carlo","last_name":"Spezzani","fullName":"Spezzani,

consists of two undulators which are used to imprint energy modulations to an electron bunch via interaction with a seed laser. Each of these so-called modulators is followed by a chicane introducing longitudinal dispersion. Proper adjustment of the amplitudes of the energy modulations and dispersive strengths allows to achieve bunching at high harmonics of the seed laser wavelength. In the near future, this seeding scheme will be utilized in one of the beamlines of the free-electron laser (FEL) user facility FLASH at DESY to provide stable seeded radiation down to the soft X-ray regime at high repetition rate. Dedicated numerical simulations are carried out within the foreseen parameter space to investigate how variations of the energy modulations due to power fluctuations of the two seed lasers affect the bunching properties and the stability of the generated FEL radiation.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/498\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Fabian","last_name":"Pannek","fullName":"Pannek, Fabian","id":"1731","affiliation":"University of Hamburg","emailHash":"20e4abc21a966f86c73a5c0082f34620","db_id":1731,"person_id":1778}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Fabian","last_name":"Pannek","fullName":"Pannek, Fabian","id":"1731","affiliation":"University of Hamburg","emailHash":"20e4abc21a966f86c73a5c0082f34620","db_id":1731,"person_id":1778},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Sven","last_name":"Ackermann","fullName":"Ackermann, Sven","id":"1730","affiliation":"Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron","emailHash":"c674fe75fbcebb312135b82011cb7713","db_id":1730,"person_id":1770},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Eugenio","last_name":"Ferrari","fullName":"Ferrari, Eugenio","id":"1733","affiliation":"Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron","emailHash":"8f799979a036f7a71d798b31a9441035","db_id":1733,"person_id":1779},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Lucas","last_name":"Schaper","fullName":"Schaper, Lucas","id":"1732","affiliation":"Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron","emailHash":"e80e5283507b8228b752a43ee34fd627","db_id":1732,"person_id":1287},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Wolfgang","last_name":"Hillert","fullName":"Hillert, Wolfgang","id":"1729","affiliation":"University of Hamburg","emailHash":"ed6f72ec740e0d0a1cf97f8976aac47c","db_id":1729,"person_id":1706}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":"Seeded FEL","session":"Tuesday posters","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"TUP73","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"166","db_id":470,"friendly_id":166,"title":"Facility Concept Outlines for a UK XFEL","startDate":{"date":"2022-08-23","time":"17:40:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2022-08-23","time":"18:00:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Exhibition Hall","room":"Exhibition Hall","note":{},"location":"Trieste Convention Centre","type":"Contributed Poster","description":"In early 2019, the UK initiated a project to develop the science case for a UK XFEL, featuring a diverse team of UK scientists and international advisors.

The ultimate goal of this plan consists in doubling the maximum photon energy available and in reducing the pulse duration below the characteristic lifetime of the atomic core levels in the source spectral range. An upgrade of FERMI aimed at reaching the oxygen K-edge requires a profound modification of the FEL configurations and of the main components of the machine, including the linac and the undulator lines. One of the most promising approaches for this upgrade is to implement the echo-enabled harmonic generation (EEHG) scheme, relying on two external lasers to precisely control the spectrotemporal properties of the FEL pulse. The conversion to EEHG of the first stage of the double-stage harmonic cascade presently in use on FEL-2, would allow to reach harmonics as high as 120, enabling to generate coherent pulses down to 2 nm. The main aspects of the upgrade strategy will be discussed in this contribution.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/414\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Luca","last_name":"Giannessi","fullName":"Giannessi,

undulator of the European XFEL. Two frequencies were generated in the first part of the undulator in alternating K configuration.  The mixing process occurred in the second part with detuned undulator segments used to generate R56. Finally, the difference frequency was radiated and amplified in a third part of the SASE3 undulator. Experiments were performed at several electron energies (11.5 GeV, 14 GeV, and 16.5 GeV) with frequency mixing generation at photon energies between 500 eV and 1.1 keV. Pulse energies were on the mJ  level, depending on the length of the radiator part. A practical application of frequency mixing at European XFEL is a possible extension of the operating range of the SASE3 undulator towards lower photon energies, by using a relatively short afterburner with longer period.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/412\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Evgeny","last_name":"Schneidmiller","fullName":"Schneidmiller,

generated at the SASE3 beamline of European XFEL via the \u201cattosecond at harmonics method\u201d. The approach was first proposed in [1]. We created bunching in the linear regime at around 0.5 keV and then, after bunching optimization by means of a magnetic chicane, we amplified the 4th harmonic bunching with a part of the undulator set to 2 keV. Due to the non-linear transformation of the bunching during the harmonic jump, radiation generated using this scheme occasionally exhibits single spike spectra (about a percent of the shots, which makes it attractive to use the method at high repetition-rate FELs). We expect those to correspond to single spikes in time-domain. We replicated the experiment numerically with the help of the GENESIS code.","folders":[{"_type":"folder","id":221,"title":null,"description":"","attachments":[],"default_folder":true,"is_protected":false}],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/330\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Andrei","last_name":"Trebushinin","fullName":"Trebushinin, Andrei","id":"513","affiliation":"European XFEL GmbH","emailHash":"de7e9c71299c86723ebc43a80b575666","db_id":513,"person_id":1672}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Andrei","last_name":"Trebushinin","fullName":"Trebushinin, Andrei","id":"513","affiliation":"European XFEL GmbH","emailHash":"de7e9c71299c86723ebc43a80b575666","db_id":513,"person_id":1672},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Gianluca","last_name":"Geloni","fullName":"Geloni, Gianluca","id":"2627","affiliation":"European XFEL GmbH","emailHash":"888c154fdafc596a3176b261a392bf3f","db_id":2627,"person_id":1277},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Svitozar","last_name":"Serkez","fullName":"Serkez, Svitozar","id":"514","affiliation":"European XFEL GmbH","emailHash":"b785e1f823ef856de0f906c5417cfd4e","db_id":514,"person_id":1559},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Giuseppe","last_name":"Mercurio","fullName":"Mercurio, Giuseppe","id":"2628","affiliation":"European XFEL GmbH","emailHash":"0bf9fb78c5cd8cfa38d6b58961d91725","db_id":2628,"person_id":2301},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Natalia","last_name":"Gerasimova","fullName":"Gerasimova, Natalia","id":"510","affiliation":"European XFEL GmbH","emailHash":"36ef4fc390ceac20f0bc5a4b2b9c3776","db_id":510,"person_id":1570},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Marc","last_name":"Guetg","fullName":"Guetg, Marc","id":"512","affiliation":"Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron","emailHash":"0609875fcc906eb507626adf9118331b","db_id":512,"person_id":1146},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Evgeny","last_name":"Schneidmiller","fullName":"Schneidmiller, Evgeny","id":"515","affiliation":"Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron","emailHash":"f8334cdfdbdfeda44bf3f593183be6b6","db_id":515,"person_id":1340}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":"First lasing","session":"First lasing","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"MOA03","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"274","db_id":603,"friendly_id":274,"title":"First Lasing of the Shanghai Soft X-ray FEL User Facility","startDate":{"date":"2022-08-22","time":"10:18:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2022-08-22","time":"10:23:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":5,"roomFullname":"Auditorium Generali","room":"Auditorium Generali","note":{},"location":"Trieste Convention Centre","type":"Contributed Oral","description":"Here we report on the first lasing of the Shanghai Soft X-ray FEL user facility (SXFEL).

The PITZ injector is also the site for the development and preparation of the high-brightness electron source for the main linac of the European XFEL and has the same pulse train structure as the X-ray photon source of the XFEL. For the proof-of-principle experiments on high-power THz generation an LCLS- I undulator (on loan from SLAC) is installed in the tunnel annex downstream of the existing accelerator. The extension of the beam line consists of a bunch compressor and a collimation system in the main PITZ tunnel, as well as a matching section, the undulator and the THz diagnostic setup in the tunnel annex. A Self-Amplified Spontaneous Emission (SASE) FEL is used to generate the THz pulses. High radiation power can be achieved by utilizing high charge (up to several nC) electron bunches from the PITZ photo injector. A beam energy of ~17 MeV is used to generate THz radiation with a centre wavelength of 100 \u03bcm. The transport of this space charge dominated electron beam and its thorough matching into the planar LCLS-I undulator with a strong vertical focusing is one of the project challenges. The installation of the first THz beamline setup was finished in summer 2022 and com-missioning with electron beam started. A specially developed procedure for a high charge beam matching into the undulator was successfully tested resulting in a first THz pulse generation. The start-up THz diagnostics is based on pyrodetectors. First measurements of the THz generation from 1,2 and 3 nC bunches have been taken, the statistics properties analysis corresponds to the expected SASE performance. The gain curve for the 3 nC case reflects the onset of saturation regime.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/605\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Mikhail","last_name":"Krasilnikov","fullName":"Krasilnikov,

Under current operating conditions, beam losses in the undulators are prevented by a collimation section downstream of the main Linac and upstream of the switchyard. In the future, a slotted foil may be installed in the European XFEL to reduce the X-ray pulse length; however, the insertion of the foil will spoil the emittance of most of the bunch which increases the probability of particles scraping the collimator and continuing to be transported to the undulator section. In this paper, we report a study to assess the level of the beam losses in the undulators in the European XFEL that would be caused by a slotted foil, and to determine the optimal apertures to use in the collimators to minimise the losses.  We also assess whether shielding or an additional collimator in front of the undulator could be added to the beamline to prevent the losses.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/535\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Andrew","last_name":"Potter","fullName":"Potter, Andrew","id":"2029","affiliation":"The University of Liverpool","emailHash":"44125317ea7d74447caefcdf8a3847f8","db_id":2029,"person_id":1834}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Andrew","last_name":"Potter","fullName":"Potter, Andrew","id":"2029","affiliation":"The University of Liverpool","emailHash":"44125317ea7d74447caefcdf8a3847f8","db_id":2029,"person_id":1834},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Andrzej","last_name":"Wolski","fullName":"Wolski, Andrzej","id":"2028","affiliation":"The University of Liverpool","emailHash":"b35c77f342f479ce653a3305ce33c5b5","db_id":2028,"person_id":1831},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Frank","last_name":"Jackson","fullName":"Jackson, Frank","id":"2026","affiliation":"Science and Technology Facilities Council","emailHash":"9571b44e7a449eef74ed9dc15df7824f","db_id":2026,"person_id":1833},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Shan","last_name":"Liu","fullName":"Liu, Shan","id":"2027","affiliation":"Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron","emailHash":"8e112890628575074c32d35aaf230c86","db_id":2027,"person_id":1143}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":"Electron beam dynamics","session":"Wednesday posters","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"WEP15","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"224","db_id":435,"friendly_id":224,"title":"Considerations on Wakefield Effects in a VUV FELO Driven by a Superconducting TESLA-Type Linac","startDate":{"date":"2022-08-24","time":"17:10:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2022-08-24","time":"17:30:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Exhibition Hall","room":"Exhibition Hall","note":{},"location":"Trieste Convention Centre","type":"Contributed Poster","description":"The electron-beam properties needed for successful implementation of a free-electron-laser oscillator (FELO) on a superconducting TESLA-type linac at the Fermilab Accelerator Science and Technology (FAST) facility include the intrinsic normalized emittance and the submacropulse centroid stability. We have demonstrated that short-range wakefields (SRWs) and long-range wakefields including higher-order modes (HOMs) are generated for off-axis beams in the two, 9-cell capture cavities and eight, 9-cell cavities of a cryomodule in the FAST linac. The resulting degradation of the emittance and centroid stability would impact the FELO performance. At 300 MeV and with the 4.5-m long, 5-cm period undulator, the saturation of a vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) FELO operating at 120 nm has previously been simulated with GINGER and MEDUSA-OPC using the non-degraded beam parameters. The measured electron-beam dynamics due to the SRWs (submicropulse, 100-micron head-tail kicks) and HOMs (submacropulse centroid slew of up to 100s of microns) will be presented. These are mitigated by steering on axis as guided by the minimization of the HOM signals. Simulations using MINERVA:OPC of the effects of submacropulse centroid slew on FELO performance will also be reported.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/435\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Alex","last_name":"Lumpkin","fullName":"Lumpkin, Alex","id":"1336","affiliation":"Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory","emailHash":"a66a124168c83b29a2612ab40b2b6542","db_id":1336,"person_id":1932},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Henry","last_name":"Freund","fullName":"Freund, Henry","id":"2819","affiliation":"University of New Mexico","emailHash":"49d126fffaae1136883cb5436986c7ac","db_id":2819,"person_id":1156},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Peter","last_name":"van der Slot","fullName":"van der Slot, Peter","id":"2479","affiliation":"University of Twente","emailHash":"be9d6d1734dd120517f470fba0ffd7f5","db_id":2479,"person_id":2251}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Alex","last_name":"Lumpkin","fullName":"Lumpkin, Alex","id":"1336","affiliation":"Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory","emailHash":"a66a124168c83b29a2612ab40b2b6542","db_id":1336,"person_id":1932},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Henry","last_name":"Freund","fullName":"Freund, Henry","id":"2819","affiliation":"University of New Mexico","emailHash":"49d126fffaae1136883cb5436986c7ac","db_id":2819,"person_id":1156},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Peter","last_name":"van der Slot","fullName":"van der Slot, Peter","id":"2479","affiliation":"University of Twente","emailHash":"be9d6d1734dd120517f470fba0ffd7f5","db_id":2479,"person_id":2251}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":"Electron diagnostics, timing, synchronization & controls","session":"Wednesday posters","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"WEP18","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"248","db_id":465,"friendly_id":248,"title":"Conceptual Design of the THz Undulator for the PolFEL Project","startDate":{"date":"2022-08-24","time":"17:10:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2022-08-24","time":"17:30:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Exhibition Hall","room":"Exhibition Hall","note":{},"location":"Trieste Convention Centre","type":"Contributed Poster","description":"PolFEL will be the first free-electron laser facility in Poland.

Two of them will feed undulators chains dedicated for VUV, and IR radiation emission, respectively, and a single THz undulator will be settled in the third branch. The design of the THz undulator has been recently accomplished. It consists of a 1560 mm long permanent magnet\u2019s structure ordered as a Halbach array of 8 periods.

A longitudinal intra bunch-train feedback system, that reduces the intra bunch-train and the train-to-train arrival time fluctuations down to the sub-10 fs level was implemented at the European X-ray free electron laser (EuXFEL). The low arrival time jitter of the electron beam is preserved in the generated photon pulses. However, over long measurement periods, additional environmental factors acting on different time scales have to be considered. These factors include the temperature, relative humidity and in case of the European XFEL ground motions due to ocean activities. Mitigation of the residual timing drifts between pump laser and FEL pulses requires additional measures to disentangle the overlaid effects. The latest results and future challenges for the long-term arrival time stabilization will be presented.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/430\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Bj\u00f6rn","last_name":"Lautenschlager","fullName":"Lautenschlager, Bj\u00f6rn","id":"1299","affiliation":"Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron","emailHash":"571e0ed20cd6a2c44b7c995095b84a2f","db_id":1299,"person_id":653}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Bj\u00f6rn","last_name":"Lautenschlager","fullName":"Lautenschlager, Bj\u00f6rn","id":"1299","affiliation":"Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron","emailHash":"571e0ed20cd6a2c44b7c995095b84a2f","db_id":1299,"person_id":653},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Marie","last_name":"Czwalinna","fullName":"Czwalinna, Marie","id":"1301","affiliation":"Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron","emailHash":"cf7ad3c1de1e5de6ba58e131c1b6baba","db_id":1301,"person_id":654},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Jiri","last_name":"Kral","fullName":"Kral, Jiri","id":"1292","affiliation":"Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron","emailHash":"80d7128314d289dfc3f498d5d4eae9cc","db_id":1292,"person_id":1206},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Jost","last_name":"Mueller","fullName":"Mueller, Jost","id":"1294","affiliation":"Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron","emailHash":"96270cb5193d9a1697a2c9b1ab12d475","db_id":1294,"person_id":1207},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Sven","last_name":"Pfeiffer","fullName":"Pfeiffer, Sven","id":"1293","affiliation":"Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron","emailHash":"19f3af967edf0231fdb0bc4152f42a2a","db_id":1293,"person_id":1208},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Holger","last_name":"Schlarb","fullName":"Schlarb, Holger","id":"1295","affiliation":"Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron","emailHash":"2e302b3dc1bb93e71100785b60d68131","db_id":1295,"person_id":1209},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Christian","last_name":"Schmidt","fullName":"Schmidt, Christian","id":"1300","affiliation":"Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron","emailHash":"1b277106dba9a088639bd4fe3f1b39a6","db_id":1300,"person_id":1210},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Sebastian","last_name":"Schulz","fullName":"Schulz, Sebastian","id":"1298","affiliation":"Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron","emailHash":"0dcd886514afd2cf0f7082d35d08c7e9","db_id":1298,"person_id":1211},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Maximilian","last_name":"Sch\u00fctte","fullName":"Sch\u00fctte, Maximilian","id":"1296","affiliation":"Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron","emailHash":"4cdaa3c5d20d3c44e2e91ac10388212f","db_id":1296,"person_id":1212},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Bernd","last_name":"Steffen","fullName":"Steffen, Bernd","id":"1297","affiliation":"Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron","emailHash":"1dbe52bb5dd2dbbcb9b94d304ff06698","db_id":1297,"person_id":1213}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":"Electron diagnostics, timing, synchronization & controls","session":"Wednesday posters","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"WEP20","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"91","db_id":532,"friendly_id":91,"title":"Design Considerations for the Extraction Line of the Proposed Third Beamline Porthos at SwissFEL","startDate":{"date":"2022-08-24","time":"17:10:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2022-08-24","time":"17:30:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Exhibition Hall","room":"Exhibition Hall","note":{},"location":"Trieste Convention Centre","type":"Contributed Poster","description":"It is planned to extend SwissFEL by a third beamline, named Porthos, operating in the hard X-ray regime.

develop complex optimization strategies and iterate them by refining algorithm\u2019s parameters.\r\nIn FERMI MIMOs optimizers are currently used with good results for fine tuning the electron beam

One important factor that must be considered is whether the additional beam losses and radiation load caused by the foil is acceptable with a high repetition rate of up to 4.5MHz at the European XFEL. As there is currently no foil implemented in the European XFEL, experimental investigations were carried out by inserting a screen in the bunch compressor at the location where a foil would be inserted. Simulations have been performed using BDSIM to study losses caused by the insertion of the foil. Neutron radiation measurements and beam loss monitor readings were taken and compared with the simulations to provide validation and calibration of the simulations for the case of a slotted foil.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/509\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Andrew","last_name":"Potter","fullName":"Potter, Andrew","id":"1852","affiliation":"The University of Liverpool","emailHash":"44125317ea7d74447caefcdf8a3847f8","db_id":1852,"person_id":1834}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Andrew","last_name":"Potter","fullName":"Potter, Andrew","id":"1852","affiliation":"The University of Liverpool","emailHash":"44125317ea7d74447caefcdf8a3847f8","db_id":1852,"person_id":1834}],"coauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Bolko","last_name":"Beutner","fullName":"Beutner, Bolko","id":"1853","affiliation":"Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron","emailHash":"e11c6a5580299c436833470d477a84a9","db_id":1853,"person_id":1247},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Julien","last_name":"Branlard","fullName":"Branlard, Julien","id":"1849","affiliation":"Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron","emailHash":"b1bbb330d80add376aaa83ecb16910bc","db_id":1849,"person_id":1248},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Andre","last_name":"Dehne","fullName":"Dehne, Andre","id":"1854","affiliation":"Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron","emailHash":"a7cf270e02ce355a7c2fa2cc462ccbb8","db_id":1854,"person_id":1832},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Frank","last_name":"Jackson","fullName":"Jackson, Frank","id":"1848","affiliation":"Science and Technology Facilities Council","emailHash":"9571b44e7a449eef74ed9dc15df7824f","db_id":1848,"person_id":1833},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Shan","last_name":"Liu","fullName":"Liu, Shan","id":"1855","affiliation":"Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron","emailHash":"8e112890628575074c32d35aaf230c86","db_id":1855,"person_id":1143},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Nicholas","last_name":"Walker","fullName":"Walker, Nicholas","id":"1850","affiliation":"Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron","emailHash":"e04ccd45b1f60b24226907170d2ff666","db_id":1850,"person_id":1835},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Andrzej","last_name":"Wolski","fullName":"Wolski, Andrzej","id":"1851","affiliation":"The University of Liverpool","emailHash":"b35c77f342f479ce653a3305ce33c5b5","db_id":1851,"person_id":1831}],"keywords":[],"track":"Electron beam dynamics","session":"Wednesday posters","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"WEP16","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"275","db_id":604,"friendly_id":275,"title":"Study of an ERL-Based X-Ray FEL","startDate":{"date":"2022-08-24","time":"17:10:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2022-08-24","time":"17:30:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Exhibition Hall","room":"Exhibition Hall","note":{},"location":"Trieste Convention Centre","type":"Contributed Poster","description":"We propose to develop an energy-recovery-linac (ERL)-based X-ray free-electron laser (FEL).

The objective with the instrument is to provide beamline users and operators with pulse resolved, non-invasive spectral distribution diagnostics, which in the hard X-ray regime is a challenge due to the poor cross-section and often very high kinetic energy of photo electrons for the available target gases. In this contribution we describe development of the device, including electron trajectory simulations, and first tests with hard X-rays at the PETRA III synchrotron where we have characterized the performance and optimized the voltage settings for resolution and electron detection efficiency. We demonstrate a resolving power of better than 5 eV up to at least 20 keV photon

With densities up to $10^{18}$ m$^{-3}$, temperatures as low as $\\sim$100 $\\mu$K for the ions, and $\\sim$1 K for the electrons, they are the ideal model plasmas to study fundamental processes in plasma physics, such as (the competition between) three-body recombination, disorder-induced heating, and collisional and collisionless microwave heating.\r\n\r\nTo study these plasmas, conventional diagnostics such as Langmuir probes are not suitable, and tools from the field of atomic and particle physics are employed instead: charged particle diagnostics for electrons and ions, and laser-induced fluorescence and absorption imaging for ions. However, these diagnostics are limited by the charged particle\u2019s time-of-flight to the detector or require optical transitions available to lasers and cameras, such as present in alkaline earth metals, to work.\r\n\r\nAt TU\/e, we recently developed a novel diagnostic that combines some of the advantages provided by the previous diagnostics. The diagnostic is based on a 5 GHz resonant microwave cavity and uses the shift in the resonance frequency of the cavity, induced by the UCP, to determine the electron dynamics of the plasma. This diagnostic allows us to study the dynamics simultaneously non-destructively, very fast (ns temporal resolution), with high sensitivity, and is a potentially interesting device for other types of plasmas as well, such as plasmas induced by extreme ultraviolet irradiation.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/475\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Mark","last_name":"Van Ninhuijs","fullName":"Van Ninhuijs, Mark","id":"1561","affiliation":"Technische Universiteit Eindhoven","emailHash":"6439c731a08678f97dec60d8259b4598","db_id":1561,"person_id":2122}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Mark","last_name":"Van Ninhuijs","fullName":"Van Ninhuijs, Mark","id":"1561","affiliation":"Technische Universiteit Eindhoven","emailHash":"6439c731a08678f97dec60d8259b4598","db_id":1561,"person_id":2122}],"coauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Job","last_name":"Beckers","fullName":"Beckers, Job","id":"1562","affiliation":"Technische Universiteit Eindhoven","emailHash":null,"db_id":1562,"person_id":2121},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Jom","last_name":"Luiten","fullName":"Luiten, Jom","id":"1563","affiliation":"Technische Universiteit Eindhoven","emailHash":"e693db5b25c403948951ad7287d07feb","db_id":1563,"person_id":1269}],"keywords":[],"track":"Photon beamline instrumentation & undulators","session":"Wednesday posters","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"WEP59","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"200","db_id":463,"friendly_id":200,"title":"Laser Plasma Accelerator Based Seeded FEL Commissioning on COXINEL at HZDR","startDate":{"date":"2022-08-24","time":"17:10:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2022-08-24","time":"17:30:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Exhibition Hall","room":"Exhibition Hall","note":{},"location":"Trieste Convention Centre","type":"Contributed Poster","description":"The tremendous developments on Laser Plasma Accelerators (LPAs) have significantly improved the electron beam properties and stability making it possible to drive a Free Electron Laser (FEL).

Our experiment, cross-checked with ELEGANT simulations, shows that the beamline enables the handling of the large divergence via high gradient quadrupoles, reducing the slice energy spread with the help of a chicane, controlling the position and dispersion in both transverse planes using beam pointing alignment compensation and implementing the super matching optics. We also show that the beamline properly allows for the spectral tuning and spatial overlapping between the electron beam and the seed, using electron and photon beam diagnostics, and thus making LPA

components. As for SASE FELs, the gain is optimized when the electron bunch travels in a straight line along the axis of each undulator in the radiator section. We have recently developed an alignment strategy for the optimization of the FERMI FELs which combines the beam-based alignment of the magnetic elements (undulators and quadrupoles) with the collinear alignment of spontaneous emission from each undulator. The method is divided into 3 steps. In the first step, we measure the undulator spontaneous emission with a spectrometer to fine-tune each undulator gap and set the best electron beam trajectory for collinear emission of each module. In the second step, the alignment of the undulator axis on the electron trajectory previously defined is achieved by looking at the undulator focusing effect. Finally, the seed laser is superposed on the electrons and aligned to maximize the bunching along the defined direction. This procedure can lead to an improvement in the control over the electron beam trajectory and results in a more efficient FEL process characterized by more stable and larger energy per pulse and a cleaner optical mode. A description of the method with the obtained results are reported in this work","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/426\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Enrico","last_name":"Allaria","fullName":"Allaria, Enrico","id":"1283","affiliation":"Elettra-Sincrotrone Trieste S.C.p.A.","emailHash":"f3da95a24a366d2b8598e5ea79ae7aa8","db_id":1283,"person_id":1500},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Alexander","last_name":"Brynes","fullName":"Brynes, Alexander","id":"1281","affiliation":"Elettra-Sincrotrone Trieste S.C.p.A.","emailHash":"25b422bb7a57220d954c29755475cdfb","db_id":1281,"person_id":1705},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Bruno","last_name":"Diviacco","fullName":"Diviacco, Bruno","id":"2706","affiliation":"Elettra-Sincrotrone Trieste S.C.p.A.","emailHash":"b65c38c0d25c133e89817857c10b4736","db_id":2706,"person_id":2337},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Luca","last_name":"Giannessi","fullName":"Giannessi, Luca","id":"1282","affiliation":"Elettra Sincrotrone Trieste and Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare","emailHash":"c5350c011f76a90ef163bde22a2ea215","db_id":1282,"person_id":448},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Carlo","last_name":"Spezzani","fullName":"Spezzani, Carlo","id":"1284","affiliation":"Elettra-Sincrotrone Trieste S.C.p.A.","emailHash":"ded8c21d82d24e03928d5f5a9fec794d","db_id":1284,"person_id":1498}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Enrico","last_name":"Allaria","fullName":"Allaria, Enrico","id":"1283","affiliation":"Elettra-Sincrotrone Trieste S.C.p.A.","emailHash":"f3da95a24a366d2b8598e5ea79ae7aa8","db_id":1283,"person_id":1500},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Alexander","last_name":"Brynes","fullName":"Brynes, Alexander","id":"1281","affiliation":"Elettra-Sincrotrone Trieste S.C.p.A.","emailHash":"25b422bb7a57220d954c29755475cdfb","db_id":1281,"person_id":1705},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Bruno","last_name":"Diviacco","fullName":"Diviacco, Bruno","id":"2706","affiliation":"Elettra-Sincrotrone Trieste S.C.p.A.","emailHash":"b65c38c0d25c133e89817857c10b4736","db_id":2706,"person_id":2337},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Luca","last_name":"Giannessi","fullName":"Giannessi, Luca","id":"1282","affiliation":"Elettra Sincrotrone Trieste and Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare","emailHash":"c5350c011f76a90ef163bde22a2ea215","db_id":1282,"person_id":448},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Carlo","last_name":"Spezzani","fullName":"Spezzani, Carlo","id":"1284","affiliation":"Elettra-Sincrotrone Trieste S.C.p.A.","emailHash":"ded8c21d82d24e03928d5f5a9fec794d","db_id":1284,"person_id":1498}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":"Photon beamline instrumentation & undulators","session":"Wednesday posters","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"WEP40","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"188","db_id":517,"friendly_id":188,"title":"Design Considerations for a New Extraction Arc at the European X-Ray Free Electron Laser","startDate":{"date":"2022-08-24","time":"17:10:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2022-08-24","time":"17:30:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Exhibition Hall","room":"Exhibition Hall","note":{},"location":"Trieste Convention Centre","type":"Contributed Poster","description":"It has been proposed that a new arc, called T20, should be installed for a third fan of undulators at the EuXFEL in the next decade. Due to geometric constraints this arc will need to be at a much larger angle than for the existing arc (T1). It is expected therefore that coherent synchrotron radiation effects in T20 on the bunch emittances will be considerable. To preserve the x-ray beam qualities in any downstream undulators, this effect will need to be understood and ideally mitigated. In this paper the status of the T20 beamline design is discussed, the expected downstream beam properties are shown and possible strategies for improving the beam quality are outlined.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/517\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Stuart","last_name":"Walker","fullName":"Walker, Stuart","id":"1928","affiliation":"Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron","emailHash":"c99bcbbd4830fd5404d342d0dfe1f39c","db_id":1928,"person_id":1989}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Stuart","last_name":"Walker","fullName":"Walker, Stuart","id":"1928","affiliation":"Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron","emailHash":"c99bcbbd4830fd5404d342d0dfe1f39c","db_id":1928,"person_id":1989}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":"Electron beam dynamics","session":"Wednesday posters","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"WEP03","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"173","db_id":574,"friendly_id":173,"title":"Design of the Innovative Apple-X AX-55 for SABINA Project, INFN \u2013 Laboratori Nazionali di Frascati","startDate":{"date":"2022-08-24","time":"17:10:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2022-08-24","time":"17:30:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Exhibition Hall","room":"Exhibition Hall","note":{},"location":"Trieste Convention Centre","type":"Contributed Poster","description":"Kyma S.p.A. was awarded the design and production of the APPLE-X undulator for SABINA project at INFN - Laboratori Nazionali di Frascati.

The name stands for Kirkpatrick-Baez Active Optical System, and it has been entirely developed in-house. After progressive revisions and upgrades, it presently empowers three out of six beamlines at FERMI, and it also serves two beamlines at FLASH, Hamburg (DiProI, LDM, MagneDyn; FL23 and FL24). Although KAOS grounds on the well-established concept of Kirkpatrick-Baez mirrors, the challenges it addressed and the needs it was built for, ultimately produced a unique system with unique features: a versatile curvature control, a broad spectral range (100 nm<\u03bb<1 nm), and a large demagnification power (>80\u00d7).  These features made KAOS an essential and mandatory tool to access the new class of scientific investigations addressed by FERMI, becoming a standard in time resolved spectroscopies, holography, and diffraction. In addition, it also enabled non-custom pump-probe spectroscopy correlation, and made the first realization of transient-grating in the XUV possible.The simple and clean mechanical design combined with the assiduous attention to online wavefront diagnostics did the rest in determining the success of KAOS over time. This contribution aims at telling how KAOS was born and grew up, showing how wavefront sensing made it work at the best, and how it will face the future challenges.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/493\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Michele","last_name":"Manfredda","fullName":"Manfredda, Michele","id":"1707","affiliation":"Elettra-Sincrotrone Trieste S.C.p.A.","emailHash":"3cd8136f8aeac6fc95a4e2fa1e73ad80","db_id":1707,"person_id":1927}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Alberto","last_name":"Simoncig","fullName":"Simoncig, Alberto","id":"1711","affiliation":"Elettra-Sincrotrone Trieste S.C.p.A.","emailHash":"9d19052201189f66fee5b4c93e037d78","db_id":1711,"person_id":1845},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Marco","last_name":"Zangrando","fullName":"Zangrando, Marco","id":"1712","affiliation":"Elettra-Sincrotrone Trieste S.C.p.A.","emailHash":"e909b4cc562ea4a4503ef8c52b8ee930","db_id":1712,"person_id":1497},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Nicola","last_name":"Mahne","fullName":"Mahne, Nicola","id":"1709","affiliation":"Istituto Officina dei Materiali, CNR, Area Science Park, S.S. 14 km 163.5, 34149 Basovizza (TS), Italy; ","emailHash":"62a7228d2374d615f4fc6121102e1b20","db_id":1709,"person_id":1844},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Michele","last_name":"Manfredda","fullName":"Manfredda, Michele","id":"1707","affiliation":"Elettra-Sincrotrone Trieste S.C.p.A.","emailHash":"3cd8136f8aeac6fc95a4e2fa1e73ad80","db_id":1707,"person_id":1927},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Simone","last_name":"Gerusina","fullName":"Gerusina, Simone","id":"1706","affiliation":"Elettra-Sincrotrone Trieste S.C.p.A.","emailHash":"a890436ad7dc928d19d563f5ac0472fb","db_id":1706,"person_id":1842},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Riccardo","last_name":"Gobessi","fullName":"Gobessi, Riccardo","id":"1708","affiliation":"Elettra-Sincrotrone Trieste S.C.p.A.","emailHash":"2d2a313e75dc26923797bf76f9a26871","db_id":1708,"person_id":1841},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Claudio","last_name":"Fava","fullName":"Fava, Claudio","id":"1713","affiliation":"Elettra-Sincrotrone Trieste S.C.p.A.","emailHash":"0b5f5917f62329403a0e42b19b3ee00e","db_id":1713,"person_id":1843},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Lorenzo","last_name":"Raimondi","fullName":"Raimondi, Lorenzo","id":"1710","affiliation":"Elettra-Sincrotrone Trieste S.C.p.A.","emailHash":"78c1051925c7ee201c852ef8625905e8","db_id":1710,"person_id":1838}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":"Photon beamline instrumentation & undulators","session":"Wednesday posters","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"WEP37","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"158","db_id":411,"friendly_id":158,"title":"Characterisation of a Diamond Channel Cut Monochromator Designed for High Repetition Rate Operation at the EuXFEL","startDate":{"date":"2022-08-24","time":"17:10:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2022-08-24","time":"17:30:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Exhibition Hall","room":"Exhibition Hall","note":{},"location":"Trieste Convention Centre","type":"Contributed Poster","description":"The European X-ray Free-Electron Laser (EuXFEL) is a unique FEL facility that provides X-ray pulses of high spectral brilliance and high photon flux at MHz repetition rate. However, the high peak power, produced in trains of up 2700 femtosecond pulses at a rate of 10 Hz, induces a periodic temperature increase of the hard X-ray monochromators, thereby reducing their transmitted intensity. To address this limitation, a diamond channel cut monochromator (DCCM) was proposed as an alternative to the currently used silicon monochromators. The heat load effect of typical EuXFEL pulses at 300 K and 100 K was simulated by finite element analysis (FEA) and indicates that the significant reduction of the transmitted intensity occurs after a higher number of pulses when compared to silicon. The DCCM first prototype was manufactured from an HPHT IIa type diamond single block and characterised by rocking curve imaging (RCI). The RCI results demonstrated the high crystalline quality of the DCCM with rocking curve widths of the same order as the width predicted by the dynamical theory and a uniformly reflected intensity over the surface. The performance as a monochromator was demonstrated by measuring the double bounce reflection. The resulting images after two successive reflections showed a diffracted beam of the same size and parallel to the incident beam and confirmed its applicability.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/411\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Kelin","last_name":"Tasca","fullName":"Tasca,

ultraviolet (XUV) and soft X-ray region, providing photon pulses of few femtosecond (fs) duration and unprecedented intensity [1]. FLASH operates in the self-amplified spontaneous emission (SASE) regime, meaning that every pulse has a unique combination of energy, spectrum, arrival time and pulse duration. Therefore, it is critical to be able to determine these parameters for each individual pulse. The THz field-driven streaking technique has the potential to deliver single-shot pulse duration information, as well as the XUV arrival time, basically wavelength-independent and over a large dynamic range (in pulse duration and FEL energy) [2, 3]. \r\n\r\nWe present the results of several campaigns measuring the single-shot pulse duration over a wide range from 10 fs to 350 fs (FWHM) [3]. Here we focus on the particular difficulties in the different pulse duration regimes. Furthermore, correlations between the pulse duration and other radiation parameters as pulse energy and spectrum are compared on a single-shot and average level as well as being compared to simulations [4]. The variable gap undulators at FLASH2 also allow to study the evolution of the XUV pulse duration for the fundamental as well as for the 3rd harmonic radiation pulse as function of contributing undulators. The best agreement between measurement and simulation was found when modeling the SASE process using an energy chirped electron pulse.\r\nFinally, a comparison of the pulse duration determined by THz streaking with an alternative pulse duration diagnostic, a transverse deflecting structure (TDS) measuring the modulation of the electron bunch (analog to [5]) is shown and the advantages, as well as limitations of both techniques, are discussed.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] W.

A new diagnostic has been developed to provide more detailed insight into the microbunching properties. This diagnostic is essentially an Infrared Spectrometer that analyzes the spectrum of the Coherent Transition Radiation emitted when the electron beam passes through a metallic screen. The Coherent Transition Radiation replicates in its spectral content the microbunching properties which, in the case of FERMI, is peaked in a range from 1 to 10 \ud835\udf07m.  A simple design based on a CaF2 prism has been preferred over the use of diffraction gratings to avoid the superposition of higher diffraction orders. A spherical mirror is employed to improve the signal-to-noise ratio and the resolution of the spectrometer. PbSe and Pyroelectric detectors are used to cover a wavelength range from 0.25 to 10 \ud835\udf07m. In this contribution, the design of the instrument together with some preliminary measurements is presented.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/392\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Marco","last_name":"Veronese","fullName":"Veronese,

electron bunches due to multiple small-angle Coulomb collisions over long propagation distances. As such, this effect may be a limiting factor for the beam current and therefore for the achievable photon energy in the SASE process. In addition, IBS influences the noise spectrum of the bunch, thus, interfering with microbunching instability (MBI) effects. An accurate estimation of IBS is, therefore, necessary for the proper application of so-called laser heaters for MBI suppression.\r\nRecent experimental evidence at the FERMI linac, SwissFEL and European XFEL suggests that IBS effects in FELs are important. A large uncorrelated energy spread of the electron beam was observed that could otherwise not be reproduced in numerical simulations. So far, however, this energy spread growth could not be clearly attributed to IBS alone. This is due primarily to the nonlinear, space-charge dominated beam dynamics in the injector for which theoretical IBS models are not applicable. For this reason, we introduce a simulation approach for the full space-charge dynamics in the injector of the European XFEL including IBS effects. The approach is based on a Monte-Carlo technique for modeling Coulomb collisions within an electron bunch of arbitrary distribution. The results for the slice energy spread along the beam line are presented for various operation conditions. This allows to identify exactly the amount by which IBS contributes to the overall uncorrelated energy spread growth in the injector.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/519\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Erion","last_name":"Gjonaj","fullName":"Gjonaj, Erion","id":"1930","affiliation":"Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt","emailHash":"342cae9c3a8db4ea5c2e539313143418","db_id":1930,"person_id":1810}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Erion","last_name":"Gjonaj","fullName":"Gjonaj, Erion","id":"1930","affiliation":"Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt","emailHash":"342cae9c3a8db4ea5c2e539313143418","db_id":1930,"person_id":1810}],"coauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Herbert","last_name":"De Gersem","fullName":"De Gersem, Herbert","id":"1931","affiliation":"Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt","emailHash":"00fe4bf1dca3a28331db2d6f999c0488","db_id":1931,"person_id":1812},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Torsten","last_name":"Limberg","fullName":"Limberg, Torsten","id":"1932","affiliation":"Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron","emailHash":"2394372b51eb5f546fe5205b013dfcd9","db_id":1932,"person_id":1811}],"keywords":[],"track":"Electron beam dynamics","session":"Wednesday posters","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"WEP14","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"142","db_id":419,"friendly_id":142,"title":"Investigation of High Absorbed Doses in the Intersections of the European XFEL Undulator Systems","startDate":{"date":"2022-08-24","time":"17:10:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2022-08-24","time":"17:30:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Exhibition Hall","room":"Exhibition Hall","note":{},"location":"Trieste Convention Centre","type":"Contributed Poster","description":"The European X-Ray Free Electron Laser (XFEL) operates three Undulator Systems to generate high-brilliance and high repetition X-ray pulses. Each System consists of multiple 5-m long undulator segments separated by 1.1-m long intersections. Such intersections contain vacuum systems, diagnostic and correction equipment for the electron's trajectory, and phase shifters (PS) [1] to match the phase of the electron beam and SASE photons. An array of Radfets monitors the absorbed doses at the entrance of each undulator segment since the start of operation in 2017 [2] but no dosimetry is available in the intersections. Recently, some SASE3 phase shifters stopped working and their motors had to be exchanged. This may have been caused by radiation damage. In this work we used Gafchromic films to measure radiation doses and its spatial profile in the intersections and PS vicinity. The measurements showed that significantly higher radiation doses are absorbed in the intersections as compared to the entrance of the next downstream undulator segment and significant radiation is also found near mechanical motors and electronic circuitry. We performed Monte Carlo simulations using the Geant4 code to investigate the composition of the radiation field in the intersections of the Undulator Systems and correlate it with the Gafchromic measurements and possible radiation damage to PS encoders and motors.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/419\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Olga","last_name":"Falowska-Pietrzak","fullName":"Falowska-Pietrzak, Olga","id":"1228","affiliation":"Stockholm University","emailHash":"be3060ff7eb417aa2f03e1575b6b97c0","db_id":1228,"person_id":1785},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Anders","last_name":"Hedqvist","fullName":"Hedqvist, Anders","id":"1227","affiliation":"Stockholm University","emailHash":"b697579752bbaf0296f0e6e1bce21523","db_id":1227,"person_id":1784},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Fredrik","last_name":"Hellberg","fullName":"Hellberg, Fredrik","id":"1224","affiliation":"Stockholm University","emailHash":"3663a07e6db1aae3b0faf88d96232c70","db_id":1224,"person_id":1790},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Guillermo","last_name":"Lopez Basurco","fullName":"Lopez Basurco, Guillermo","id":"1226","affiliation":"Universidad Autonoma de Madrid","emailHash":"86693dff836fec3c11d386834c15d3fc","db_id":1226,"person_id":1792},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Frederik","last_name":"Wolff-Fabris","fullName":"Wolff-Fabris, Frederik","id":"1225","affiliation":"European XFEL GmbH","emailHash":"e5d3075892a246abb51f2a6206bf350f","db_id":1225,"person_id":1793}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Olga","last_name":"Falowska-Pietrzak","fullName":"Falowska-Pietrzak, Olga","id":"1228","affiliation":"Stockholm University","emailHash":"be3060ff7eb417aa2f03e1575b6b97c0","db_id":1228,"person_id":1785}],"coauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Anders","last_name":"Hedqvist","fullName":"Hedqvist, Anders","id":"1227","affiliation":"Stockholm University","emailHash":"b697579752bbaf0296f0e6e1bce21523","db_id":1227,"person_id":1784},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Fredrik","last_name":"Hellberg","fullName":"Hellberg, Fredrik","id":"1224","affiliation":"Stockholm University","emailHash":"3663a07e6db1aae3b0faf88d96232c70","db_id":1224,"person_id":1790},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Guillermo","last_name":"Lopez Basurco","fullName":"Lopez Basurco, Guillermo","id":"1226","affiliation":"Universidad Autonoma de Madrid","emailHash":"86693dff836fec3c11d386834c15d3fc","db_id":1226,"person_id":1792},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Frederik","last_name":"Wolff-Fabris","fullName":"Wolff-Fabris, Frederik","id":"1225","affiliation":"European XFEL GmbH","emailHash":"e5d3075892a246abb51f2a6206bf350f","db_id":1225,"person_id":1793}],"keywords":[],"track":"Photon beamline instrumentation & undulators","session":"Wednesday posters","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"WEP58","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"128","db_id":385,"friendly_id":128,"title":"Development of a Table-Top THz Free-Electron Laser with a Microtron Accelerator and a Hybrid Electro-Magnetic Undulator","startDate":{"date":"2022-08-24","time":"16:20:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2022-08-24","time":"16:40:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Exhibition Hall","room":"Exhibition Hall","note":{},"location":"Trieste Convention Centre","type":"Contributed Poster","description":"We were able to realize a compact microtron accelerator with 5 MeV electron beam acceleration energy and a hybrid electro-magnetic undulator that can vary the magnetic field of 1.07 T at 0.74 T.

This is done, in the case of the FERMI FEL, by finding the optimal quadrupole strengths in various matching sections using a particle tracking code. This contribution reports an upgrade to the matching tools in use in the FERMI control room: the functionalities of two existing programs have been merged into a single tool; and some new options are

geometric structural properties of matter. Such investigations can now be realized with femtosecond temporal resolution owing to the availability of X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) [1]. However, most XFELs currently utilize self-amplified spontaneous emission (SASE), which causes strong shot-to-shot fluctuations of their intensity and spectral distribution. Consequently, SASE fluctuations represent a challenge for the precise normalization of the measured absorption signal to the incident photon flux. \r\nHere, we have developed normalization schemes utilizing diffractive optics that overcome the SASE fluctuations. The diffractive optics are used to split the incoming XFEL SASE beam into two or three identical copies (\u00b11 and 0th orders). By placing the (solid or liquid jet) sample in one of the diffracted beams, the absorption and reference signals are recorded simultaneously, thus enabling efficient data normalization on a shot-to-shot basis.  \r\nIn this contribution, we will present diffractive optics for two normalization schemes at SASE XFELs. First, a three beam geometry based on beam-splitting silicon off-axis zone plate [2] for soft XAS implemented at the Spectroscopy and Coherent Scattering beamline at the European XFEL to study L2,3 edges of transition metals will be presented. Secondly, a two-beam configuration for hard X-ray transient absorption spectroscopy of liquid jets (K-edge, an aqueous solution of [Fe(C2O4)3]3-) will be reported. Here, a beam-splitting transmission diamond grating for focused hard X-rays in combination with bent silicon <220> crystal was experimentally tested at the ALVRA station at the SwissFEL (\u0394E\/E \u2248 3% bandwidth). The results demonstrate high-quality K-edge transient XAS of [Fe(C2O4)3]3- solution without the need to scan the monochromator [3]. These normalization schemes pave the way for ultrafast L- and K-edge XAS measurements of transition metals at XFELs.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/528\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Talgat","last_name":"Mamyrbayev","fullName":"Mamyrbayev, Talgat","id":"1988","affiliation":"Paul Scherrer Institute","emailHash":"215d13d7a11d3280bca875a649c66300","db_id":1988,"person_id":1608}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Talgat","last_name":"Mamyrbayev","fullName":"Mamyrbayev, Talgat","id":"1988","affiliation":"Paul Scherrer Institute","emailHash":"215d13d7a11d3280bca875a649c66300","db_id":1988,"person_id":1608}],"coauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Joan","last_name":"Vila-Comamala","fullName":"Vila-Comamala, Joan","id":"1982","affiliation":"Paul Scherrer Institute","emailHash":"44101f8355c4d621bf9afa9464636780","db_id":1982,"person_id":1609},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Loic","last_name":"Le Guyader","fullName":"Le Guyader, Loic","id":"1978","affiliation":"European XFEL GmbH","emailHash":null,"db_id":1978,"person_id":1560},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Yohei","last_name":"Uemura","fullName":"Uemura, Yohei","id":"1989","affiliation":"European XFEL GmbH","emailHash":"501bb4a000bf1961fa67ba4b22c1c631","db_id":1989,"person_id":1607},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Pavle","last_name":"Juranic","fullName":"Juranic, Pavle","id":"1983","affiliation":"Paul Scherrer Institut","emailHash":null,"db_id":1983,"person_id":1474},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Claudio","last_name":"Cirelli","fullName":"Cirelli, Claudio","id":"1987","affiliation":"Paul Scherrer Institute","emailHash":"cc6b26d5d4d4dcbfd715002f5bc42628","db_id":1987,"person_id":1604},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Frederico","last_name":"A.

With the same orbit launched into the undulators, first measurement data have shown a correlation between the magnitude of the introduced orbit disturbance in the injector and the SASE intensity in the undulators.

The design of the monochromator is challenged by a demand to control both photon energy resolution and temporal resolution; the aim to transport close to transform-limited pulses poses very high demands on the optics quality, in particular on the grating. Presently, the monochromator operates with two gratings: the low-resolution grating is optimized for time-resolved experiments and allows for moderate resolving power of about 2000 - 5000 along with pulse stretching of few to few tens of femtoseconds RMS, and the high-resolution grating reaches resolving power of 10000 at a cost of larger pulse stretching. The examples of time-resolved experiments and experiments performed in high photon energy resolution mode are presented. In addition, being operational in spectrometer mode, the monochromator is regularly used for the spectral characterization of the FEL beam including photon pulse length retrieval.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/567\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Natalia","last_name":"Gerasimova","fullName":"Gerasimova,

geometries as the beam\u2019s transverse velocity never vanishes. However, a significant challenge lies in tuning and measuring the fields with limited access to the beam axis along the undulator. Confirming the good field region off axis is difficult without space for 3D hall probe scans, and is important for low energy beams used to create THz radiation. We present our tuning procedures developed for the meter-long THESEUS undulators, consisting of two orthogonal permanent magnet Halbach arrays shifted by a quarter period relative to one another. The hall probe and pulsed wire measurements are guided by the general field expansion of helical undulators to correctly tune fields on and near the axis.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/401\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Andrew","last_name":"Fisher","fullName":"Fisher, Andrew","id":"1051","affiliation":"Particle Beam Physics Lab (PBPL)","emailHash":"370c9b8597741a510ed639a7e8196caa","db_id":1051,"person_id":1514},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Jason","last_name":"Jin","fullName":"Jin, Jason","id":"1050","affiliation":"Particle Beam Physics Lab (PBPL)","emailHash":"a78934aff5d6ddf0c4df4b0eb50b453b","db_id":1050,"person_id":1513},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Pietro","last_name":"Musumeci","fullName":"Musumeci, Pietro","id":"2826","affiliation":"Particle Beam Physics Lab (PBPL)","emailHash":null,"db_id":2826,"person_id":2024}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Andrew","last_name":"Fisher","fullName":"Fisher, Andrew","id":"1051","affiliation":"Particle Beam Physics Lab (PBPL)","emailHash":"370c9b8597741a510ed639a7e8196caa","db_id":1051,"person_id":1514},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Jason","last_name":"Jin","fullName":"Jin, Jason","id":"1050","affiliation":"Particle Beam Physics Lab (PBPL)","emailHash":"a78934aff5d6ddf0c4df4b0eb50b453b","db_id":1050,"person_id":1513},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Pietro","last_name":"Musumeci","fullName":"Musumeci, Pietro","id":"2826","affiliation":"Particle Beam Physics Lab (PBPL)","emailHash":null,"db_id":2826,"person_id":2024}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":"Photon beamline instrumentation & undulators","session":"Wednesday posters","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"WEP50","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"45","db_id":545,"friendly_id":45,"title":"Application of Machine Learning in Longitudinal Phase Space Prediction at the European XFEL","startDate":{"date":"2022-08-24","time":"17:10:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2022-08-24","time":"17:30:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Exhibition Hall","room":"Exhibition Hall","note":{},"location":"Trieste Convention Centre","type":"Contributed Poster","description":"For a free-electron laser facility, the longitudinal phase space of the beam is essential to the FEL lasing performance.

The fast drift velocity and high radiation tolerance properties of chemical vapor deposition (CVD) diamonds make these crystals a good candidate material for developing a high frame rate pass-through diagnostic for the next generation of XFELs. We report on two diamond based diagnostic systems being developed by a collaboration of a UC campuses and National Laboratories supported by the University of California and the SLAC National Laboratory. \r\n\r\nFor the first of these diagnostic systems, we have developed a new approach to the readout of diamond diagnostic sensors designed to facilitate operation as a passthrough detection system for high frame-rate XFEL diagnostics. Making use of the X-ray Pump Probe (XPP) beam at the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS), the performance of this new diamond sensor system has been characterized and compared to that of a commercially available system. Limits in the magnitude and speed of signal charge collection are explored as a function of the generated electron-hole plasma density and compared to results from a TCAD simulation. \r\n\r\nA leading proposal for improving the efficiency of producing longitudinally coherent FEL pulses is the cavity-based X-ray free electron laser (CBFEL). In this configuration, the FEL pulses are recirculated within an X-ray cavity in such a way that the fresh electron bunches interact with the FEL pulses stored in the cavity over multiple passes. This creates a need for diagnostics that can measure the intensity and centroid of the X-ray beam on every pass around the recirculatory path. For the second of these diagnostic systems, we have created a four-channel, position-sensitive pass-through diagnostic system that can measure the intensity and centroid of the circulating beam with a repetition rate in excess of 20 MHz. The diagnostic makes use of a planar diamond sensor thinned to 43 \u00b5m to allow for minimal absorption and wave-front distortion of the circulating beam. We present results on the response and position sensitivity of the diagnostic, again measured using the LCLS XPP beam.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/500\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Rene","last_name":"Padilla","fullName":"Padilla,

fields ranging from\r\natomic and molecular physics to plasma and solid state physics as well as chemistry and biology.\r\nMany experiments could benefit from a non-destructive online photon diagnostic of the provided\r\nx-ray pulses. Especially, for free-electron lasers that are operated in the self-amplified sponta-\r\nneous emission (SASE) regime, where the pulse characteristics fluctuate from pulse to pulse [1],\r\nreliable online information on the intensity, spectral distribution, and temporal structure of\r\neach individual pulse can be crucial. A fast feedback can significantly improve an on-the-fly\r\nevaluation of user experiments. In addition, subsequent sorting of measurement data by, for ex-\r\nample, intensity or wavelength can reveal signatures of physical processes that would otherwise\r\nbe hidden in the fluctuation. Finally, real-time information about the pulse can give a direct\r\nfeedback for FEL beam tuning.\r\n\r\n\r\nNeural networks became popular as a powerful analysis tool in all categories of science [2]. This\r\nis due to their ability to recognize complex relationships in large datasets. There are various\r\narchitectures of neural networks, each with its own focus on specific tasks. What they all have in\r\ncommon is that they need to be trained during a training process in order to recognize patterns\r\nand correlations. A special case of training is performed in unsupervised learning, where the\r\nnetwork does not need any expert knowledge about the data. This can be done for example with\r\nautoencoder networks [3]. These networks consist of an encoder and a decoder. The encoder\r\nlearns during the training phase to compress data to lower dimensionality, the so-called latent\r\nspace, the decoder to reconstruct the input from this compressed representation. This means\r\nthat, given the decoder, the latent space contains all information needed to reconstruct an in-\r\nput sample. A special form of autoencoder networks are \u03b2 Variational Autoencoder (\u03b2-VAE)\r\nnetworks [4], that allow to balance between the goal of a perfect reconstruction of the data and\r\na perfect disentanglement of the latent space vector components. These networks are found to\r\nbe able to find the key principles in an unlabeled data set, even if these principles were not\r\nknown before.\r\n\r\nWe demonstrate the usage of \u03b2-VAEs to characterize SASE X-ray pulses of the free electron\r\nlaser FLASH in Hamburg. We combine data from different diagnostic devices. We evaluate\r\nmeasured data from the online photoionization spectrometer OPIS [5], that uses 4 electron time\r\nof flight spectrometers to monitor each individual FEL pulse. In addition, we include data from\r\nan X-band transverse deflecting mode cavity diagnostic system (XTCAV). The latter is simi-\r\nlar to the XTCAV at the Linac Coherent Light Source [6]. This device measures the position\r\nand kinetic energy of the electrons after they have passed the undulator and is therefore able\r\nto monitor the differences in the temporal structure of the electron bunches due to the lasing\r\nprocess. We demonstrate that a \u03b2-VAE can detect key principles in the XTCAV and the OPIS\r\ndata, like pulse duration and central wavelength and compare them to other diagnostic devices\r\nsuch as data from a gas monitor device (GMD) [7] and THz field-driven streaking [8]. Without a-priori knowledge the network is able to find directly human-interpretable representa-\r\ntions of single-shot FEL spectra, remove noise as well as reveal data artefacts and hence allows\r\nfor an improved in-depth analysis of photon diagnostics data.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/382\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Gesa","last_name":"Goetzke","fullName":"Goetzke,

Laser (XFEL) and all RF stations can deliver sufficient power to reach maximum gradients in the accelerating modules, limited only by cavity and coupler properties. It was demonstrated that by activating a dynamic frequency shift (DFS) of the RF drive signal, the requested klystron power can be reduced by up to 20%, keeping the gradient levels unchanged. Currently the high voltage (HV) pulse has a length of 1.7ms and the RF pulse a length of 1.42ms, out of which only 0.6ms can be used for beam acceleration. Currently, the RF pulse starts when the level of klystron HV reaches 99% of the nominal voltage. If one allows the RF pulse to start at the 80% level of the nominal voltage, then the RF pulse length can be increased. In this article we will present a proposal for increasing the XFEL RF pulse flattop length using phase and amplitude compensation during the rise and fall of the HV, as well as applying DFS when filling the cavities of the accelerator. The first demonstration of the proposed procedure with the 10MW multi-beam klystrons (MBK) at the klystron test stand and at the XFEL RF station A10.L3 will be presented as well. The described procedure can be used both to increase the duration of the RF flat top as well as to shorten the duration of the HV, which could lead to energy savings.","folders":[{"_type":"folder","id":200,"title":null,"description":"","attachments":[],"default_folder":true,"is_protected":false}],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/542\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Vladimir","last_name":"Vogel","fullName":"Vogel,

Seven deflectors were produced by PSI of which five were installed in three experiments at DESY, while the remaining two were installed in the ATHOS soft X-ray beamline in SwissFEL, with the goal to provide sub-fs resolution for soft X-ray pulse profiles. Early this year the X-band power source of the TDS for SwissFEL was completed and system commissioning started.

compared with the permanent magnet undulators when operating at high frequency, therefore producing FEL radiation at the same wavelength with less electron energy. This paper investigates the properties of a Ka-band microwave undulator, and the factors that affect the choice of the high-power drive sources, through the design and beam dynamic study of a 36GHz cavity-type microwave undulator proposed for the CompactLight X-ray FEL. The future research is to prototype a millimeter-wave undulator operating at ~100GHz, which will have an undulator period of about 1\/10 of the state-of-the-art permanent magnet undulators. The millimeter-wave undulator will allow the generation of soft X-ray radiation at much lower beam energy, such as hundreds of MeV, enabling a reduction in the cost of a compact XFEL facility.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/433\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Liang","last_name":"Zhang","fullName":"Zhang, Liang","id":"1332","affiliation":"University of Strathclyde and Cockcroft Institute","emailHash":"b31f1e6753c9c6e3213a56ccc9e73019","db_id":1332,"person_id":647},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Jack","last_name":"Easton","fullName":"Easton, Jack","id":"1331","affiliation":"Department of Physics, SUPA, University of Strathclyde","emailHash":"7c1212855c01019ac4e4d6437905ee87","db_id":1331,"person_id":648},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Craig","last_name":"Donaldson","fullName":"Donaldson, Craig","id":"1330","affiliation":"University of Strathclyde and Cockcroft Institute","emailHash":"3fa54d135c443284810ccd1763f60e5b","db_id":1330,"person_id":646},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Colin","last_name":"Whyte","fullName":"Whyte, Colin","id":"2722","affiliation":"University of Strathclyde","emailHash":"0797924a234ea2ce5148752dd83bc431","db_id":2722,"person_id":2348},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Adrian","last_name":"Cross","fullName":"Cross, Adrian","id":"1328","affiliation":"University of Strathclyde and Cockcroft Institute","emailHash":"21d4cf0f22d8624ca2b2bbe8a63cf4b5","db_id":1328,"person_id":645},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Jim","last_name":"Clarke","fullName":"Clarke, Jim","id":"1333","affiliation":"Science and Technology Facilities Council and Cockcroft Institute","emailHash":"9ca4d2037eb881ba20eafc6d00879962","db_id":1333,"person_id":644}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Liang","last_name":"Zhang","fullName":"Zhang, Liang","id":"1332","affiliation":"University of Strathclyde and Cockcroft Institute","emailHash":"b31f1e6753c9c6e3213a56ccc9e73019","db_id":1332,"person_id":647},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Jack","last_name":"Easton","fullName":"Easton, Jack","id":"1331","affiliation":"Department of Physics, SUPA, University of Strathclyde","emailHash":"7c1212855c01019ac4e4d6437905ee87","db_id":1331,"person_id":648},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Craig","last_name":"Donaldson","fullName":"Donaldson, Craig","id":"1330","affiliation":"University of Strathclyde and Cockcroft Institute","emailHash":"3fa54d135c443284810ccd1763f60e5b","db_id":1330,"person_id":646},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Colin","last_name":"Whyte","fullName":"Whyte, Colin","id":"2722","affiliation":"University of Strathclyde","emailHash":"0797924a234ea2ce5148752dd83bc431","db_id":2722,"person_id":2348},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Adrian","last_name":"Cross","fullName":"Cross, Adrian","id":"1328","affiliation":"University of Strathclyde and Cockcroft Institute","emailHash":"21d4cf0f22d8624ca2b2bbe8a63cf4b5","db_id":1328,"person_id":645},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Jim","last_name":"Clarke","fullName":"Clarke, Jim","id":"1333","affiliation":"Science and Technology Facilities Council and Cockcroft Institute","emailHash":"9ca4d2037eb881ba20eafc6d00879962","db_id":1333,"person_id":644}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":"Photon beamline instrumentation & undulators","session":"Wednesday posters","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"WEP60","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"123","db_id":456,"friendly_id":123,"title":"Demonstration of Hard X-ray Multiplexing using Microbunch Rotation through an Achromatic Bend","startDate":{"date":"2022-08-24","time":"17:10:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2022-08-24","time":"17:30:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Exhibition Hall","room":"Exhibition Hall","note":{},"location":"Trieste Convention Centre","type":"Contributed Poster","description":"Electrons in a X-ray free electron laser (XFEL) develop periodic density fluctuations, known as microbunches, which enable the exponential gain of X-ray power in an XFEL.  When an electron beam microbunched at a hard X-ray wavelength is kicked, microbunches are often washed out due to the dispersion and R56 of the bend.  An achromatic (dispersion-free) bend with small R56, however, can preserve microbunches, which rotate to follow the new trajectory of the electron bunch.  Rotated microbunches can subsequently be lased in a repointed undulator to produce a new beam of off-axis X-rays.  In this work, we demonstrate hard X-ray multiplexing in the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) Hard X-ray Undulator Line (HXU) using microbunch rotation through a 10 microrad first-order-achromatic bend created by transversely offsetting quadrupole magnets in the FODO lattice.  Quadrupole offsets are determined analytically from beam-matrix theory.  We also discuss the application of microbunch rotation to out-coupling a cavity-based XFEL (CBXFEL)

It has been designed to enable most challenging measurements in terms of X-rays sample sensitivity and signal detection level. The energies accessible on DEIMOS beamline rank from 350 eV up to 2500 eV, with all polarizations (circular left and right, linear), covering the absorption edges of the elements most relevant to the magnetic nanostructure scientific community, i.e. the first (3d) and second (4d) rows transition metals L-edges, the rare earth elements M-edges and nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur K-edges. While its main end station, a 7 Tesla cryomagnet, allows for measurements down to sub-Kelvin temperature up to room temperature, its second end station, a 2 Tesla electromagnet, is currently under renovation thanks to the partnership between Italian power supply constructor OCEM Power Electronics and French electromagnet manufacturer SEF Technologies. \r\nThe coil is made of hollow copper to allow direct cooling in order to achieve the required 2 Tesla field strength. The magnetic model of this coil has been studied and validated before manufacturing. The new power supply will have a four quadrant fast switching topology, with a high stability output. To increase the reliability, the architecture is a proven modular technology coming from previous realizations running in other facilities. Once renovated, the so-called MK2T end station will allows for fast switching (1 Hz) between +\/-2 Tesla. It will be aimed to host most peculiar inserts such as variable temperature liquid cell, high temperature (1000 K) and multiferroic inserts. Commissioning is expected as early as autumn 2022 and the facility could be available to users through standard review of the SOLEIL program committee, at the upcoming call for proposal.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/601\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Miguel","last_name":"Pretelli","fullName":"Pretelli,

through a short undulator (modulator) provides an energy modulation which can be converted to a periodic longitudinal density modulation (or microbunching) via the R56 term of a chicane. Such pre-bunching of a beam at the resonant wavelength and the harmonics of a subsequent free-electron laser (FEL) amplifier seeds the process and results in improved gain in a TESSA** experiment. We describe potential characterizations of the resulting microbunched electron beams after the modulator using coherent optical transition radiation (COTR) imaging techniques for transverse size (50 micron), divergence (sub-mrad), trajectory angle (0.1 mrad), coherence factor, spectrum (few nm), and pulse length (ps). The transverse spatial alignment is provided with near-field imaging and the angular alignment is done with far-field imaging and two-foil COTR interferometry (COTRI). Analytical model results for a 515-nm wavelength COTRI case with a 10% microbunching fraction will be presented. COTR gains of 22 million were calculated for an initial charge of 1000 pC which enables splitting the optical signal for single-shot measurements of all the cited parameters.\r\n\r\n**Tapering Enhanced Super-radiant Stimulated Amplification (TESSA)\r\n*Work supported by U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, under Contract No. DE-AC02-06CH11357.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/454\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Alex","last_name":"Lumpkin","fullName":"Lumpkin, Alex","id":"1446","affiliation":"Argonne National Laboratory","emailHash":"a66a124168c83b29a2612ab40b2b6542","db_id":1446,"person_id":1932},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Donald","last_name":"Rule","fullName":"Rule, Donald","id":"2693","affiliation":"Naval Surface Warfare Center","emailHash":"be6b0166b374154ba0a8114251c1c978","db_id":2693,"person_id":2332},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Pietro","last_name":"Musumeci","fullName":"Musumeci, Pietro","id":"2692","affiliation":"University of California, Los Angeles","emailHash":"ffe6745ab3dbfbb84ee29d263aa15780","db_id":2692,"person_id":1512}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Alex","last_name":"Lumpkin","fullName":"Lumpkin, Alex","id":"1446","affiliation":"Argonne National Laboratory","emailHash":"a66a124168c83b29a2612ab40b2b6542","db_id":1446,"person_id":1932}],"coauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Donald","last_name":"Rule","fullName":"Rule, Donald","id":"2693","affiliation":"Naval Surface Warfare Center","emailHash":"be6b0166b374154ba0a8114251c1c978","db_id":2693,"person_id":2332},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Pietro","last_name":"Musumeci","fullName":"Musumeci, Pietro","id":"2692","affiliation":"University of California, Los Angeles","emailHash":"ffe6745ab3dbfbb84ee29d263aa15780","db_id":2692,"person_id":1512},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Alex","last_name":"Murokh","fullName":"Murokh, Alex","id":"2471","affiliation":"RadiaBeam Technologies","emailHash":"e5921355f58e34ffd560760a1a33ff36","db_id":2471,"person_id":1519}],"keywords":[],"track":"Electron diagnostics, timing, synchronization & controls","session":"Wednesday posters","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"WEP17","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"133","db_id":449,"friendly_id":133,"title":"Experimental Slice Emittance Reduction at PITZ using Laser Pulse Shaping","startDate":{"date":"2022-08-24","time":"17:10:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2022-08-24","time":"17:30:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Exhibition Hall","room":"Exhibition Hall","note":{},"location":"Trieste Convention Centre","type":"Contributed Poster","description":"At the Photo Injector Test facility at DESY in Zeuthen (PITZ) photo electron guns for the use at the X-ray free-electron laser (FEL) facilities FLASH and European XFEL are conditioned. An electron beam with high current and low transverse emittance is required for high performance in an X-ray FEL.\r\nAs the lasing process occurs on the part of the electron bunch with the highest charge density the emittance of this part is of interest. A scheme to measure the slice emittance which uses a transversely deflecting structure and a single-slit scan has been developed at PITZ. This allows the beam characterisation at low beam energies and high charge densities.\r\nThe contribution shows that using laser pulses with temporal flattop shape (and temporal Gaussian shape) or

Thus the lasing performance will be decreased. The Shanghai high-repetition-rate XFEL and extreme light facility (SHINE) is under construction and the wakefields estimations are required. The SHINE contains three different undulator lines (FEL-\u2160- \u2162) designed for different functions. The wakefields of FEL-\u2160 undulator section has been studied in our work before. However the wakefields of inner segments between undulators are calculated simply. In this paper, we calculate the wakefields of inner segments considering more exquisite structures in FEL-\u2160. We consider gradual changed connections between beam pipes of different diameters and dechirpers. We compared wakefields of different schemes of inner segments. Based on the results, we give some suggestions for the designation of the inner segments in FEL-\u2160.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/406\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"He","last_name":"Liu","fullName":"Liu, He","id":"1105","affiliation":"Shanghai Institute of Applied Physics","emailHash":"d7362699f4966c7bba3ae2e9f7d30772","db_id":1105,"person_id":1888},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Jiawei","last_name":"Yan","fullName":"Yan, Jiawei","id":"1108","affiliation":"European XFEL GmbH","emailHash":"de4f0791757caec4a3d4f0f063c0e8a5","db_id":1108,"person_id":1192},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Haixiao","last_name":"Deng","fullName":"Deng, Haixiao","id":"1109","affiliation":"Shanghai Advanced Research Institute Chinese Academy of Science","emailHash":"2b3c12e717d08134e0dc1fda35ab2a4d","db_id":1109,"person_id":1193},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Bo","last_name":"Liu","fullName":"Liu, Bo","id":"1107","affiliation":"Shanghai Advanced Research Institute Chinese Academy of Science","emailHash":null,"db_id":1107,"person_id":1889}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"He","last_name":"Liu","fullName":"Liu, He","id":"1105","affiliation":"Shanghai Institute of Applied Physics","emailHash":"d7362699f4966c7bba3ae2e9f7d30772","db_id":1105,"person_id":1888},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Jiawei","last_name":"Yan","fullName":"Yan, Jiawei","id":"1108","affiliation":"European XFEL GmbH","emailHash":"de4f0791757caec4a3d4f0f063c0e8a5","db_id":1108,"person_id":1192},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Jun-Jie","last_name":"Guo","fullName":"Guo, Jun-Jie","id":"2759","affiliation":"Zhangjiang Laboratory Shanghai","emailHash":"85e02e6a6296caa1eef741585c752794","db_id":2759,"person_id":1648},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Haixiao","last_name":"Deng","fullName":"Deng, Haixiao","id":"1109","affiliation":"Shanghai Advanced Research Institute Chinese Academy of Science","emailHash":"2b3c12e717d08134e0dc1fda35ab2a4d","db_id":1109,"person_id":1193},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Bo","last_name":"Liu","fullName":"Liu, Bo","id":"1107","affiliation":"Shanghai Advanced Research Institute Chinese Academy of Science","emailHash":null,"db_id":1107,"person_id":1889},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Tao","last_name":"Liu","fullName":"Liu, Tao","id":"2760","affiliation":"Shanghai Advanced Research Institute Chinese Academy of Science","emailHash":"87e8434c1fbeafcb741b0106ff0a69b4","db_id":2760,"person_id":2357}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":"Electron beam dynamics","session":"Wednesday posters","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"WEP05","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"65","db_id":405,"friendly_id":65,"title":"Magnetic Field Investigation in a Compact Superconducting Undulator with HTS Tape","startDate":{"date":"2022-08-24","time":"17:10:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2022-08-24","time":"17:30:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Exhibition Hall","room":"Exhibition Hall","note":{},"location":"Trieste Convention Centre","type":"Contributed Poster","description":"The superconducting undulator (SCU) based on the second-generation high-temperature superconducting (HTS) tapes is a promising application for building tabletop free-electron lasers (FELs).

The advantage of the HTS tape is that it shows both high critical current density and high critical magnetic field.

As revealed from ELEGANT simulation of the high brightness driver linac system, a residual energy chirp of about 42 keV\/\uf06dm is left after bunch compression. It can be corrected by a capacitive dechirper structure when the bunch is slightly over-compressed. We successfully used a 1-m long corrugated pipe to remove the residual energy chirp in such simulation. However, in order to save space and for a simplified mechanical design, we consider also the usage of two orthogonally oriented planar dielectric-lined waveguide (DLW) structures to remove residual energy chirp after bunch compression. Wake fields due to this DLW dechirper has been calculated by CST code and the deduced wake function will be used in particle tracking using ELEGANT.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/537\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Chih-Kai","last_name":"Liu","fullName":"Liu, Chih-Kai","id":"2044","affiliation":"Department of Physics, National Central University","emailHash":"d60a16fce74f327f3a49c374f6cb753e","db_id":2044,"person_id":2146},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Shih-Hung","last_name":"Chen","fullName":"Chen, Shih-Hung","id":"2043","affiliation":"Department of Physics, National Central University","emailHash":"677e0a5375875ac2482e56ed1f32b0c3","db_id":2043,"person_id":2144},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Wai-Keung","last_name":"Lau","fullName":"Lau, Wai-Keung","id":"2047","affiliation":"National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center","emailHash":"37de18d979916ddd4d1f3e55fd076009","db_id":2047,"person_id":2145},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Wei-Yuan","last_name":"Chiang","fullName":"Chiang, Wei-Yuan","id":"2046","affiliation":"National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center","emailHash":"967ef00b1c8382e01df7e6dbd6835b83","db_id":2046,"person_id":2142},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Shan You","last_name":"Teng","fullName":"Teng, Shan You","id":"2045","affiliation":"Department of Physics, National Central University","emailHash":"f5a4ce86925b347969c0ce8f7b80eb64","db_id":2045,"person_id":2143}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Chih-Kai","last_name":"Liu","fullName":"Liu, Chih-Kai","id":"2044","affiliation":"Department of Physics, National Central University","emailHash":"d60a16fce74f327f3a49c374f6cb753e","db_id":2044,"person_id":2146},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Shih-Hung","last_name":"Chen","fullName":"Chen, Shih-Hung","id":"2043","affiliation":"Department of Physics, National Central University","emailHash":"677e0a5375875ac2482e56ed1f32b0c3","db_id":2043,"person_id":2144},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Wai-Keung","last_name":"Lau","fullName":"Lau, Wai-Keung","id":"2047","affiliation":"National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center","emailHash":"37de18d979916ddd4d1f3e55fd076009","db_id":2047,"person_id":2145},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Wei-Yuan","last_name":"Chiang","fullName":"Chiang, Wei-Yuan","id":"2046","affiliation":"National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center","emailHash":"967ef00b1c8382e01df7e6dbd6835b83","db_id":2046,"person_id":2142},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Shan You","last_name":"Teng","fullName":"Teng, Shan You","id":"2045","affiliation":"Department of Physics, National Central University","emailHash":"f5a4ce86925b347969c0ce8f7b80eb64","db_id":2045,"person_id":2143}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":"Electron beam dynamics","session":"Wednesday posters","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"WEP08","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"241","db_id":531,"friendly_id":241,"title":"Determination of a High-Power Short THz single pulse Detector for FEL.","startDate":{"date":"2022-08-24","time":"17:10:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2022-08-24","time":"17:30:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Exhibition Hall","room":"Exhibition Hall","note":{},"location":"Trieste Convention Centre","type":"Contributed Poster","description":"Terahertz (THz) radiation may pass through dielectric materials, and this ability can be used for a variety of applications.

Performing the LPS measurement with the future TDC is limited in two regards: it is destructive and may be low in resolution as compared to the maximum compression possible in the MAX IV linac. In this project we propose using machine learning tools to implement a virtual diagnostic to retrieve the LPS information non-destructively using fast, non-invasive measurements and critical set-points in the linac as inputs for a neural network.

The first phase, with up to 35 MeV electron beam energy, has been operated since 2018 for a wide range of accelerator applications. The second phase, presently being installed, will expand the range of applications by taking the beam to 250 MeV energy and via a dog-leg to an experimental station that will feature a new high-power laser. A third phase utilising the 250 MeV beam in the straight-ahead line is also envisaged. Machine learning will play an important role in the future development of the facility, with aims to rapidly deliver bespoke beam properties, to detect and diagnose anomalies, and to provide virtual diagnostics. This paper summarises machine learning developments to date, in the areas of RF breakdown detection, photo-injector laser pulse shaping, and longitudinal phase space shaping. Studies to date have largely been offline or using simulated data but steps towards deployment are also reported.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/408\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"David","last_name":"Dunning","fullName":"Dunning, David","id":"1111","affiliation":"Science and Technology Facilities Council","emailHash":"74e4e23e00949d5d54e94aa458b05732","db_id":1111,"person_id":1898},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Amelia","last_name":"Pollard","fullName":"Pollard, Amelia","id":"1117","affiliation":"Science and Technology Facilities Council","emailHash":"9ca5793ab33b4552feb22da16a34051b","db_id":1117,"person_id":1922},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Minerva","last_name":"Maheshwari","fullName":"Maheshwari, Minerva","id":"2821","affiliation":"Science and Technology Facilities Council","emailHash":"99deb671e184c22fbe53b984bbb7babf","db_id":2821,"person_id":2392},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Anthony","last_name":"Gilfellon","fullName":"Gilfellon, Anthony","id":"1113","affiliation":"Science and Technology Facilities Council","emailHash":"50abe4c67ebff6e512bbfab89e264f39","db_id":1113,"person_id":1921},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"William","last_name":"Okell","fullName":"Okell, William","id":"1116","affiliation":"Science and Technology Facilities Council","emailHash":"4e3c9509bfa010ccb49c96c67f7d3436","db_id":1116,"person_id":1924},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Edward","last_name":"Snedden","fullName":"Snedden, Edward","id":"2822","affiliation":"Science and Technology Facilities Council","emailHash":"b5f726aef56fea14333562c01b95198b","db_id":2822,"person_id":2272}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"David","last_name":"Dunning","fullName":"Dunning, David","id":"1111","affiliation":"Science and Technology Facilities Council","emailHash":"74e4e23e00949d5d54e94aa458b05732","db_id":1111,"person_id":1898},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Amelia","last_name":"Pollard","fullName":"Pollard, Amelia","id":"1117","affiliation":"Science and Technology Facilities Council","emailHash":"9ca5793ab33b4552feb22da16a34051b","db_id":1117,"person_id":1922},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Minerva","last_name":"Maheshwari","fullName":"Maheshwari, Minerva","id":"2821","affiliation":"Science and Technology Facilities Council","emailHash":"99deb671e184c22fbe53b984bbb7babf","db_id":2821,"person_id":2392},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Anthony","last_name":"Gilfellon","fullName":"Gilfellon, Anthony","id":"1113","affiliation":"Science and Technology Facilities Council","emailHash":"50abe4c67ebff6e512bbfab89e264f39","db_id":1113,"person_id":1921},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"William","last_name":"Okell","fullName":"Okell, William","id":"1116","affiliation":"Science and Technology Facilities Council","emailHash":"4e3c9509bfa010ccb49c96c67f7d3436","db_id":1116,"person_id":1924},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Edward","last_name":"Snedden","fullName":"Snedden, Edward","id":"2822","affiliation":"Science and Technology Facilities Council","emailHash":"b5f726aef56fea14333562c01b95198b","db_id":2822,"person_id":2272}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":"Electron diagnostics, timing, synchronization & controls","session":"Wednesday posters","references":[],"board_number":"","code":"WEP31","subContributions":[]},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadataWithSubContribs","id":"208","db_id":400,"friendly_id":208,"title":"Fabrication of X-Ray Gratings by Grey-Tone Electron-Beam Lithography and Thermal Oxidation of Silicon","startDate":{"date":"2022-08-24","time":"17:10:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2022-08-24","time":"17:30:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Exhibition Hall","room":"Exhibition Hall","note":{},"location":"Trieste Convention Centre","type":"Contributed Poster","description":"Diffraction gratings are an essential instrument used at free-electron laser facilities in soft and tender x-ray ranges. Their application ranges from monochromators and analyzers to self-seeding and pulse compression. These gratings are typically around 50-200 mm, up to 500mm in length with pitches from a few micrometers down to a few 100 nm, made on flat or curved substrates. Blazed gratings exhibiting higher efficiency are made by the ruling technique, however, the production of high-quality blazed gratings has become a significant bottleneck due to challenges in their fabrication and few suppliers.\r\nIn this presentation, we report on a novel method for production of next-generation X-ray diffraction gratings based on gray-tone electron-beam lithography (EBL) and thermal oxidation of silicon. We can take advantage of the greatly enhanced flexibility regarding the grating design, allowing for enhanced optical performance as well as novel optical functionalities.\r\nThis new technology will enable researchers all around the world to exploit fully the unique opportunities provided by the dramatically enhanced brilliance and coherence of a new generation of light sources.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.jacow.org\/event\/44\/contributions\/400\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Nazanin","last_name":"Samadi","fullName":"Samadi,
